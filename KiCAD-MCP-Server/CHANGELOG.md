# Changelog

All notable changes to the KiCAD MCP Server project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### New Tools

- **Digi-Key Product Information V4 integration** — `digikey_search_parts`,
  `digikey_check_library_availability` and `digikey_test_connection`. The server
  had six JLCPCB tools and nothing for Digi-Key, so every stock check, lifecycle
  check and replacement hunt happened in one-off scripts outside it.

  `digikey_search_parts` searches by part number, MPN, or a parametric phrase and
  returns stock, price, lifecycle status, every packaging variation and the
  parametric table. `digikey_check_library_availability` sweeps a `.kicad_sym`
  and reports which parts are obsolete, out of stock, unfindable, not orderable,
  or carry no part number at all — searching by distributor number first and MPN
  second, because retired Digi-Key numbers are the common failure and the MPN
  usually still resolves. Part numbers are read under any of the property
  spellings real libraries use. A symbol whose lookup fails is marked
  `state: "error"` and the sweep continues, so one transient 500 does not throw
  away the lookups already paid for; five consecutive failures stop it, because a
  revoked key fails identically for every remaining symbol. The sweep costs up to
  two rate-limited requests per symbol, so `maxSymbols` defaults to 25 and the
  command is granted the extended Node-side timeout in `src/command-timeout.ts` —
  on the 30 s default the timer fires mid-sweep and the caller loses every lookup
  the sweep had already paid for.

  Three things the API makes easy to get wrong:
  - The locale headers are mandatory. Without `X-DIGIKEY-Locale-Site` and its two
    companions a search returns **404**, which reads like a wrong URL. The client
    always sends them; the values are configurable.
  - The Digi-Key part number is not on the product. It lives on each entry of
    `ProductVariations`, so the reel and the cut tape have different numbers.
    `preferPackaging` picks which one is quoted and matches localized packaging
    names. A product with no variations at all is reported as `not_orderable`
    rather than available, since there is no number to put on an order.
  - `ProductStatus.Status` is localized, so comparing it against `"Active"`
    reports every part as a problem once the account is not set to English.
    Lifecycle is read from `ProductStatus.Id`.

  **Credentials never enter the source tree.** They are read from
  `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID` and `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET` in the environment, optionally
  via the already-gitignored `.env`, and are deliberately absent from every tool
  schema — a key passed as a tool argument would be recorded in the conversation,
  in the MCP log, and in anything replaying the call. Absent from the schema means
  such an argument is _ignored_, not rejected: the MCP layer strips unknown keys,
  so the tools now return a `warnings` entry naming the argument and telling the
  caller to rotate the value, which is the honest description of what happened.
  Everything leaving the module passes through a redaction step, and a non-JSON
  response body or a hostile `Retry-After` is converted into a redacted error
  rather than escaping as an unfiltered traceback. Tests assert all of it,
  including that the schemas contain no credential-shaped field, that `.env` is
  gitignored, and that `.env.example` carries names without values.

  Nothing here has been exercised against the live Digi-Key service: there were no
  working credentials available (the token endpoint answers
  `401 invalid_client`), so every test drives a mocked transport and the
  German-language strings in the fixtures are constructed illustrations of the
  localization hazard rather than captured responses. `ACTIVE_STATUS_ID = 0` is
  documented in the source as an assumption to confirm on first real use.

### New Features

- **`set_net_color`** (#375): set or clear an individual net's display color
  override — the PCB editor's "Net colors" panel, previously not reachable
  by any tool. `net_settings.net_colors` has no SWIG counterpart
  (`NETINFO_ITEM` has no color getter/setter), so this is pure `.kicad_pro`
  JSON persistence, same read/modify/write-atomically shape already used by
  `assign_net_to_class`. Accepts a `#RRGGBB` hex color, or `clear: true` to
  remove the override and revert to the automatic/class color. Cosmetic
  only — does not affect routing or design rules.

### Bug Fixes

- **A missing kicad-skip no longer kills every tool at startup** (#389, @AmirF194).
  Six modules imported `from skip import Schematic` at their own top level.
  Two of them sit on the import chain `kicad_interface` -> `schematic_handlers`
  -> `library_schematic`/`schematic`, which runs before the process reaches
  its own try/except import guard, so a missing kicad-skip raised an
  unhandled `ModuleNotFoundError` at startup instead of the intended clean
  JSON error. Three of the six modules never actually used the import and
  had it removed; the other three guard it now. `create_schematic` and
  `load_schematic`, the two tools that genuinely need kicad-skip, raise a
  `SchematicLoadError` naming the exact `pip install kicad-skip` command
  instead of taking the rest of the server down with them.
- **`setup-windows.ps1` / `setup-windows-opencode.ps1`** (#356, @LiJoeAllen): find
  KiCad on any drive. The registry uninstall keys (HKLM, WOW6432Node, HKCU) and the
  installer's `KICAD<ver>_*` environment variables are probed before the hard-coded
  `C:\Program Files` paths, and the version root is derived from `DisplayIcon` by
  walking up out of `bin\`, so a `D:\KiCad\10.0` install no longer ends in "KiCAD
  not found". The generated config now pins `KICAD_PYTHON` to the bundled
  interpreter, so the server runs KiCad's own Python rather than whichever one is
  first on PATH - the v10 failure mode where `pcbnew` imports in one interpreter
  and not the other. The two scripts' probing logic is kept in sync by
  cross-reference comments, since both carry a copy of `Get-KiCadInfo`.
- **`modify_trace` reachable by UUID, `add_net` honours `netClass`** (#403,
  reported by @joseluu): the tool's zod schema declares `traceUuid` but the
  handler read `uuid`, so the documented UUID path always answered "Missing
  trace identifier" and only the position fallback worked. `add_net` had the
  same shape - schema `netClass`, handler `class` - so the net class was
  silently dropped. Both handlers now read the schema's name and keep the old
  key for JSON-RPC callers. The slip had recurred often enough (#392 found five
  more in the JSON-RPC schema) that a new ratcheting test,
  `tests/test_schema_param_names.py`, compares every tool's declared parameter
  names against the keys its Python handler actually reads, on both schema
  layers, and checks that every TypeScript tool has a Python route. What it
  found on first run is frozen as known lists that may only shrink - 12 tools
  with an ignored Node-facing parameter, 16 with a stale JSON-RPC one, and six
  tools whose command has no route at all - and tracked in #407. Also fixes
  the `microViaD iameter` typo in the JSON-RPC schema for `set_design_rules`.
- **No more `PCB_VIA::GetWidth` assert dialog on KiCad 9/10, and KiCad 8 works
  again** (#398, @scorp508): KiCad 9 moved vias onto per-layer padstacks, so the
  no-argument `GetWidth()` a via inherits pops a modal wxWidgets assert, once per
  via, when listing traces or stitching a ground plane. Two earlier call sites had
  dodged the dialog with `GetWidth(pcbnew.F_Cu)`, which does not exist on KiCad 8.
  A `_via_front_width()` shim now prefers `GetFrontWidth()` where it exists and
  falls back to the bare call on KiCad 8. Also fixes a MagicMock test double that
  had the stitching-via tests running with 1 nm vias.
- **Discovery tools no longer tell clients to call the deleted `execute_tool`**
  (#397, @scorp508): `execute_tool` was removed in May, but `list_tool_categories`,
  `get_category_tools` and `search_tools` still said to use it, sending models
  after a tool that does not exist. The text now says what is true: every tool is
  callable directly by name. A test checks the runtime output for stale names.
- **KiCad launched from PATH is detected on Linux** (#401, @famez): the process
  probe required `/kicad` or `/pcbnew` with a leading slash in the `ps` line, so a
  KiCad started from a desktop launcher or a terminal (bare `argv[0]`) reported
  "not running". An exact basename match is accepted as well; the Windows branch
  is untouched.
- **Five JSON-RPC schema parameters renamed to what the handlers read** (#392,
  @karpovantonme): `set_active_layer` takes `layer`, `add_net` takes `name`,
  `add_copper_pour` takes `net`, `export_gerber` takes `outputDir`, `delete_trace`
  takes `traceUuid`. This is the schema the standalone JSON-RPC path's `tools/list`
  returns (`python/schemas/tool_schemas.py`); the zod schemas Node clients see
  already used these names. `add_net` keeps `netClass`, which the handler reads
  since #403.

- **`sync_schematic_to_board` reads only the design's own sheets, and wires an
  unlabeled net instead of dropping it** (#400 reported by @SinanTufekci; #402
  reported by @joseluu, with the fix for the unlabeled case taken from #358 by
  @davidwesternall-oss). The pad-to-net map was built from every `.kicad_sch`
  under the project directory, so KiCad's own `.history/` snapshots, this
  server's `.mcp-backups/` copies and hand-made backup folders were read as live
  sheets, and whichever sorted last silently overwrote the live nets (25 wrong
  pad nets on one real board). The map now follows `(sheet ...)` references from
  the root, through the walker `backannotate_footprints` already used, promoted
  to `python/utils/sheet_tree.py`. Separately, a net formed only by a wire
  between two pins, with no label or power symbol, was named by nothing, so its
  pads reached the board with no net at all. Such a net now gets the name KiCad
  itself would give it, `Net-(REF-PadN)`, built from the pad number and taking
  the candidate that sorts lowest as a plain string; both details were checked
  against kicad-cli 10.0.0. `PWR_FLAG` symbols no longer seed a bogus `PWR_FLAG`
  net. The response lists every unmatched pad (`unmatched_pads`, with a
  warning) and the sheets read (`sheets_scanned`) instead of a ten-entry
  sample. The unused `skip` imports in this function and in
  `get_connections_for_net` are gone, so a missing kicad-skip now surfaces the
  loader's `SchematicLoadError` message there too (#393 follow-up).
- **Placing a symbol no longer writes KiCad 10-only attributes into KiCad 8 or 9
  schematics, and `add_schematic_component` honours `angle` and `mirrorY`**
  (#351 by @Rotario, taken over; the orientation fix was also in #358 by
  @davidwesternall-oss). `create_component_instance` wrote `(body_style 1)` and
  `(in_pos_files yes)` into every placed symbol regardless of the file's
  declared format. Neither token exists in a KiCad 8 (20231120) or KiCad 9
  (20250114) file, and KiCad's parser refuses tokens it does not know, so a
  KiCad 8 or 9 user got "Failed to load schematic" from a file this server had
  just edited; four of the five shipped templates declare 20250114. Both tokens
  are now emitted only into files whose `(version ...)` is 20260101 or later,
  and a file with no version token keeps the KiCad 10 output. KiCad 10 itself
  accepts a v9 file either way (checked with kicad-cli 10.0.0). Separately, the
  TypeScript layer nests the documented `angle` and `mirrorY` inside `component`
  and the Python handler never read them, so every symbol landed unrotated and
  callers had to follow up with `rotate_schematic_component`; both are read
  now. The escaping half of #351 had already landed in #354.

### Tooling

- **Documentation trued up to the shipped server, and the tool inventory is now
  generated and gated in CI** (#396, @scorp508): the inventory listed 137 tools
  while the server registers 233 (173 of them indexed by `search_tools`); other
  documents still described the tool-gating design removed a year ago, and two
  documented tools did not exist. A generator script now derives
  `docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.md` from the tool sources and the registry, preserving
  hand-written descriptions, and `npm run docs:tools:check` runs in the
  TypeScript CI job so the inventory cannot drift again. Around twenty documents
  corrected.
- **One implementation of the KiCad text-file helpers** (#395, @kkkhs, closes
  #380): the four private `_read_text` / `_write_text` copies in
  `add_symbol_property`, `backannotate_footprints`, `library_tables` and
  `set_symbol_pin_type` are replaced by `python/utils/file_io.py`
  (newline-preserving read, atomic write). Two of the four gain temp-file cleanup
  on a failed write, which the other two already had.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-20

### New Tools

- **`find_duplicate_symbols`** — group symbols in a `.kicad_sym` that are the
  same part stored twice under different names. Libraries collect these the
  moment more than one source feeds them: an Eagle import lands a part the
  curated library already had, a SnapEDA download arrives under the vendor's
  naming, someone re-adds a part because search did not find the existing name.
  KiCad reports nothing, because the names differ — which is also why grepping
  for the name does not find it.

  Matches on manufacturer part number, distributor part number, Value +
  Footprint, an identical drawn body, or names differing only in separators. The
  MPN match normalises property names first, because a real library holds that
  field as `MPN`, `MP`, `MANUFACTURER PART NUMBER` and `PART NUMBER` depending on
  which importer wrote it, and a plain group-by therefore finds nothing. A value
  that only marks a field as unfilled — `N/A`, `TBD`, `-`, KiCad's `~` — is never
  a key, since grouping on one collects every part the importer knew nothing
  about. Each group reports which strategy and which property produced it, and
  groups are merged by connected component, so no symbol is reported twice and
  the redundant-symbol count cannot exceed what the library holds.

  `schematicPaths` counts instances per symbol across the project's sheets,
  which turns the report into a decision: the duplicate nothing places is the
  one to retire. `suggestedKeep` names it and says why. Counting is attributed
  to _this_ library by lib_id nickname — resolved from the file name and from
  the `sym-lib-table` beside each scanned sheet, overridable with
  `libraryNicknames` — because a bare `R` or `LED` collides with `Device:` and
  `power:` constantly, and crediting another library's placements here
  recommends keeping the copy nothing uses. A sub-sheet instantiated four times
  counts four times, autosave sheets and backup/history folders are skipped
  because they duplicate sheets already being counted, and a `schematicPaths`
  entry that does not exist is reported in `missingPaths` instead of leaving the
  report to claim that nothing is used.

  `graphics` is off by default. Verified against a 489-symbol library: matching
  on the drawn body alone put 78 resistor symbols spanning 53 distinct values
  into one group, because every resistor shares one drawing. It stays available
  for hunting a custom part copied under a new name, and is documented as
  evidence rather than verdict. With the defaults, and 20 sheets of the same
  project scanned, that library reports 78 groups covering 107 redundant
  symbols, 61 of which no schematic places — including five symbols for one TI
  transceiver, of which one is in use. Nickname attribution changed the advice
  for three of those groups: each recommended keeping a symbol this library
  never places, because a same-named symbol in an Eagle-import library was being
  counted towards it, and for one of them the symbol it proposed to retire had
  the only two real placements.

- **`set_symbol_pin_type`** — set the electrical type, and optionally the
  graphic style, of pins in a `.kicad_sym` library, filtered by symbol, pin
  number, pin name, or current type. The server could read pins
  (`list_symbol_pins`, `batch_list_symbol_pins`) but not write them, so bulk
  fixes were done with `sed` over the library file.

  That is unsafe in ways that are easy to miss. A blind substitution also
  rewrites the words it matches inside symbol names, `Description` properties
  and `(alternate "SPI_CLK" output line)` pin functions; it cannot tell which
  symbol it is standing on, so "only the shield pins" is not expressible; and
  nothing validates the replacement token, which matters because KiCad refuses
  to load a library containing a pin type it does not recognise and reports the
  file rather than the pin. This tool checks the token against KiCad's sets
  before touching the file, and rewrites only the pin head.

  The usual reason to need it: symbols converted from Eagle or pulled from
  SnapEDA arrive with every pin `unspecified` or `bidirectional`, and ERC then
  reports conflicts on nets that are electrically fine, burying the real errors.
  `fromType` makes that a one-liner, and `dryRun` shows the list first.

  Nothing that can be mistyped fails silently. An unrecognised `type`, `style`
  or `fromType` is refused before the library is opened, and a `symbols`,
  `pinNumbers` or `pinNames` entry that matched nothing comes back in
  `missingSymbols`, `missingPinNumbers` or `missingPinNames`. A _derived_
  symbol is told apart from a typo: `(extends "R_Small")` means the symbol has
  no pins of its own, so it is reported in `symbolsWithoutOwnPins` with a
  pointer to the parent rather than as a name absent from the library.

  The library is replaced atomically -- the new text is built in a sibling
  temporary file that is renamed over the original, the same guarantee `sed -i`
  gives -- so a failed or interrupted write cannot leave a truncated part
  library behind. A timestamped copy also goes into a sibling `.mcp-backups/`
  directory (the convention `_auto_save_board` already uses for boards, and
  already covered by `.gitignore`) and its path is returned in `backupPath`,
  because the rename only protects against a crash: omitting `symbols` is the
  natural way to call this tool and flattens every pin in the library, and that
  edit succeeds. The backup is best effort and never blocks the edit. The
  file's existing line endings are preserved, which is what keeps a 32-pin edit
  to a 32-line diff rather than rewriting every line of a library checked out
  with LF endings on a Windows host. Because a whole-library pass changes
  thousands of pins and this is an MCP tool whose response is spent from the
  model's context window, `changes` carries at most 200 per-pin records and sets
  `changesTruncated`; `changeCount`, `alreadyCorrect` and `symbolsChanged`
  always describe the whole run. The edits are spliced into the file in one
  pass, because rebuilding it per pin copies the whole library once for every
  pin changed -- ~440 GB of copying and a 169-second call on KiCad's own 16 MB
  `MCU_ST_STM32H7` (28191 pins), against ~8 seconds spliced once.

  Verified on a 2.2 MB library: 2279 pins across 472 symbols walked correctly,
  32 pins changed, paren balance unmoved, `kicad-cli sym upgrade` accepted the
  result, and a second pass was a no-op.

### New Features

- **`list_library_table`, `remove_library_table_entry`, `set_library_table_uri`**
  — the read, delete and repoint counterparts to `register_symbol_library` and
  `register_footprint_library`. Registering a library was the only table
  operation the server could do, so cleaning up after a library migration meant
  hand-editing `sym-lib-table` / `fp-lib-table`. The obvious way to do that in
  a script — `content.replace(")", ...)` on the closing paren — corrupts a
  table whose last entry ends on the same line.

  These work on parsed `(lib ...)` spans: rows are located as the direct
  children of the table — never by scanning raw text for `(lib`, so an ordinary
  Eagle-import description like `(descr "Caps (X7R), see (lib old)")` cannot
  invent a phantom row — the edit slices exactly that span, and **the result is
  re-parsed before it is written**. A rewrite that would leave the table
  unbalanced is refused and the file is left alone. Multi-line rows (which newer
  KiCad writes) are handled, and batch removal cuts from the back so earlier
  offsets stay valid.

  `scope="global"` resolves to the machine-wide table in KiCad's user config,
  which every project on the machine loads, so writes are made through a
  temporary file and `os.replace` rather than truncating in place, keep the
  file's existing newline style instead of rewriting all 200-odd lines to CRLF,
  and copy the previous contents into a sibling `.mcp-backups/` directory first.
  Both mutating tools accept `dryRun` to report the edit without performing it.
  `tablePath` is checked against the table's root element, so it cannot be aimed
  at an unrelated `.kicad_pcb` that happens to contain a matching `(lib ...)`.

  `list_library_table` also resolves each URI through `${KIPRJMOD}`, KiCad's
  built-in library directories, the path variables configured in
  `kicad_common.json`, and the environment, then reports whether the file is
  actually there. The built-in directories matter: KiCad defines
  `KICAD10_SYMBOL_DIR` and its siblings internally, so they appear in neither
  `kicad_common.json` nor the environment, and resolving from those two sources
  alone reports every row of a stock table as pointing at a missing file — 225
  of 226 on a default install. They are resolved against the discovered KiCad
  install, reusing the same finders `commands.library_symbol` and
  `commands.library` already use. A variable that genuinely nothing defines is
  still reported as missing rather than treated as a literal path. This is what
  turns "ERC reports hundreds of `footprint_link_issues`" into "this one row
  points at a library that moved".

  KiCad 10's `(type "Table")` rows are recognised as indirections rather than
  libraries: the stock global table is a single row named `KiCad` standing for
  200+ libraries, so listing reports how many each one covers and removing one
  says how many libraries that unregisters.

### New Tools

- **`backannotate_footprints`** — copy footprint assignments from a `.kicad_pcb`
  back into the schematic's `Footprint` fields. The server had
  `sync_schematic_to_board` (F8) but nothing in the reverse direction, so after
  a layout pass — where footprints get swapped in pcbnew — the schematic kept
  stale values, and every ECO run pushed them back onto the board. Imported
  projects have the same problem from day one: the schematic-side fields never
  matched the placed parts.

  Matches by reference designator, updates all units of a multi-unit symbol, and
  skips virtual references starting with `#` (power and ground symbols carry no
  footprint). Instances with no `Footprint` field get one added unless
  `addMissing` is false; `dryRun` reports the diff without writing. The
  `lib_symbols` cache is left alone — instance fields override it, and rewriting
  the cache is a different tool.

  The designators come from each symbol's `(instances ...)` block, which is
  where KiCad 7+ keeps one per sheet instance; the `(property "Reference" ...)`
  holds only one of them. A sub-sheet placed twice therefore contributes both
  designators, and because those instances share a single `Footprint` field,
  nothing is written when the board disagrees between them — the references and
  the differing footprints go into `conflicts` instead. A reference the board
  carries on two footprints is refused the same way. Footprints placed on the
  board with no matching symbol — the mounting holes and test points added
  directly in pcbnew — are listed under `notInSchematic` rather than dropped.

  Updating a field rewrites _only_ the quoted value token, so `hide`,
  `show_name`, `unlocked`, justification, font and the field's exact layout are
  left byte-for-byte alone: the file stays what eeschema would have written. Only
  the `addMissing` insertion path builds a field from scratch, because there is
  no existing state to keep. Writes are atomic and preserve each file's existing
  line endings, so a one-field edit is a one-line diff on an LF checkout.

  Sheets are found by walking the real sheet tree from the root schematic beside
  the board, so `.history` snapshots, backup copies, unrelated projects in the
  same directory and orphaned sheets are never rewritten. Every sheet is planned
  before any is written, and a write that fails lands in `failures` with the rest
  of the report intact instead of leaving earlier sheets edited.

  Parsing is structural rather than regex-based, which matters for two real
  cases: footprint names containing parentheses (`HRS_U.FL-R-SMT-1(10)` is a
  stock Hirose connector) and board files whose indentation does not track
  nesting. Verified end to end on copies of two real projects: on a 251-footprint
  board it rewrote 263 stale fields in the one sheet of the design, left the
  `.history` copy and a second project in the same directory untouched, reported
  four board-only mounting holes, and `kicad-cli sch upgrade` accepted the
  result; on a 244-footprint hierarchical board already in sync it reported no
  changes, walked 9 of the 10 `.kicad_sch` files (the tenth is referenced by
  nothing) and flagged one genuine duplicate board reference. Both second passes
  were byte-for-byte no-ops.

  The s-expression walkers this needed (`match_paren`, `iter_child_offsets`) live
  in `utils/sexpr_format.py` so later tools can share them instead of carrying
  another private paren counter.

### New Features

- **`validate_schematic` and `validate_symbol_library`** — locate structural
  damage in `.kicad_sch` / `.kicad_sym` files. `kicad-cli` answers whether a
  file loads, but not why: one misplaced paren in a 40 000-line library
  produces `Unable to load library` and nothing else, leaving a manual bisect
  as the only way forward. These tools report the line and column of each
  fault.

  A single string-aware pass catches unbalanced parens, unterminated strings
  and trailing content — parens inside quoted values such as
  `"Ceramic (X7R) 50V"` are text, so the naive `count("(") - count(")")` check
  that gives false positives on real libraries is not used. On top of that:
  - **Orphaned fragments.** A `(property ...)`, `(effects ...)` or `(at ...)`
    sitting directly under `(kicad_sch ...)` — or, in a `.kicad_sym`, an
    `(effects ...)`, `(at ...)`, `(hide ...)`, `(font ...)` or `(justify ...)`
    directly inside a `(symbol ...)` — is what a truncated property rewrite
    leaves behind. It is balanced, so nothing that counts parens notices, and
    KiCad refuses to open the file — kicad-cli 10.0.4 answers
    `Unable to load library` for a perfectly balanced library with either
    fragment misplaced. The `.kicad_sym` rule is deliberately not applied to
    `.kicad_sch`, where `(at ...)` is a legal child of a placed `(symbol ...)`.
  - **Stale unit names.** Renaming a symbol without renaming its `NAME_0_1`
    sub-symbols makes the _whole library_ unloadable — confirmed against
    kicad-cli 10.0, which is why this is graded an error rather than a warning.
  - **Escaped units.** A dropped paren promotes a unit to the top level, where
    its name still says which symbol it came from. Graded a _warning_, because
    the library does still load (kicad-cli returns 0) — it just loads wrong:
    KiCad reads the unit as a symbol of its own, so the parent keeps none of
    those graphics or pins and `symbolCount` comes out too high.
  - **Duplicate symbol names**, where KiCad silently keeps one.

  When the paren structure is _unbalanced_, every node past the break nests one
  level too deep, so the name checks are skipped rather than reporting hundreds
  of consequences of the one real problem: on a real 487-symbol library a single
  deleted `)` went from 489 reported errors to 2. Since `unclosed_form` can only
  ever blame the outermost form (line 1), an indentation heuristic — KiCad writes
  one tab per level — points at the first line where nesting stops matching
  indentation, which is where the paren actually went missing. That heuristic
  runs on every tab-indented file, not only when something else already failed,
  because the case it is needed for most is a paren fault that _nets to zero_ —
  one dropped and a later one spare, which is what a bad slice-and-splice edit
  produces. Nothing counts its way to that fault and kicad-cli reports no
  position for it, so the indentation is the only evidence there is.

  `kicad-cli` then runs on a throwaway copy as the authoritative answer, so a
  file that passes the scan but not KiCad is still reported. The copy is not
  optional: `upgrade` rewrites in place, and a validator must not modify the
  file it is validating. Pass `runKicadCli: false` for a structure-only check
  or when KiCad is not installed.

### Bug Fixes

- **IPC sessions are no longer silently pinned to SWIG** (#369 by
  @Vikrammel). `get_open_board_path` predated kipy's DocumentSpecifier shape,
  so the IPC probe always failed and the session fell back to the SWIG
  backend without saying so. It now reads `get_open_documents(DOCTYPE_PCB)`
  and resolves the path from `board_filename` plus the project path.

- **Symbol property values containing an escaped quote were silently
  truncated** (#336). KiCad escapes a quote inside a double-quoted token as
  `\"`. Readers using the obvious `"([^"]*)"` stop at that escaped quote, so
  the value came back as a lone backslash — and emitting that back out escapes
  the closing quote, running the token on and swallowing the rest of the file.

  This was not theoretical: **419 of the 22,712 stock KiCad 10 symbol files**
  across 13 libraries have a Description wrapped in escaped quotes, including
  every `Connector_Generic` part. Reading one returned `\` rather than the
  description.

  Reading and writing now share one escape-aware implementation in
  `utils.sexpr_format` (`QUOTED_VALUE`, `escape_sexpr_string`,
  `unescape_sexpr_string`), replacing five ad-hoc readers and three writers.
  The three writers escaped quotes but not backslashes, which is a no-op on
  precisely the values that break — order matters, and they had it wrong.

- **`add_gnd_stitching_vias` treated arcs as their chord** (#192). Since
  `route_arc_trace` landed, `board.GetTracks()` can return `PCB_ARC` items. The
  obstacle loop distinguished only `PCB_VIA` from everything else, so an arc
  was recorded as the straight chord between its endpoints — under-stating the
  region it occupies. A candidate via sitting in the bulge between chord and
  arc passed the clearance check and could short the trace.

  Measured on a 10 mm-radius quarter arc against real KiCad: a point lying
  exactly on the arc read as **2.93 mm** from the chord, so any via within that
  bulge was waved through.

  Arcs are now sampled into a chain of chords. The sampling radius is inflated
  so the chain circumscribes the arc rather than cutting inside it —
  over-approximating an obstacle is safe, under-approximating is the bug.

  Thanks to @NiNjA-CodE, whose analysis in the issue identified the exact
  branch and consequence.

- **The MCP transport connects before Python starts, not up to two minutes
  after** (#377). Python + pcbnew/wxApp initialisation takes 55-125 s, and
  the transport only connected afterwards -- so every request a client sent
  in that window sat unread on the server's stdin. Clients stack one drain
  listener per unresolved send, which is exactly the reported
  `MaxListenersExceededWarning (count: 11)` crash in opencode, and is also
  why clients could hit their connect timeout outright. Tools, resources and
  prompts are registered in the constructor and need no Python, so
  `initialize`/`tools/list`/`prompts/get` now answer immediately; tool
  _calls_ queue behind a ready gate so their timeouts do not run against
  Python's own startup, and the explicit warm-up skips itself when a queued
  command is already exercising the backend.
- **`sync_schematic_to_board` no longer duplicates footprints when reference
  designators diverge** (#250, reported by @Dewieinns). Sync matched purely on
  reference strings, so a schematic re-annotated after layout made every
  component look "missing" and added a second copy of the whole board at the
  origin. Board footprints are now also matched by their schematic symbol
  UUID (the last segment of `GetPath()`, which kicad-cli's netlist reports as
  `<tstamps>` -- format verified against real KiCad 10): a comp whose UUID is
  already bound to a board footprint under a different name is skipped with
  an explanatory reason instead of duplicated. Reused-sheet instances share a
  symbol UUID; each unmatched comp claims one unclaimed footprint.
- **An unwritable JLCPCB data directory no longer crashes the whole server**
  (#264 by @fage2022). `JLCPCBPartsManager` raised `PermissionError` at
  construction -- which happens at import time, so one broken directory took
  down all tools with `ModuleNotFoundError`-adjacent startup failures. The
  manager now disables itself with a logged warning and every operation
  returns an empty result. Taken from PR #264 with credit; that PR's
  unrelated `_fix_perms.py` helper and `sys.path` change are deliberately
  not included.
- **`get_schematic_view` renders always have a working SVG-to-PNG converter**
  (#274 by @stefangordon, adjusted per review). The converter chain had no
  declared dependency, so a stock install silently fell back to the raw
  full-sheet SVG -- which ignores the requested width/height and easily
  exceeds an MCP client's inline size cap. `pymupdf` is now declared in
  requirements.txt as the first-priority converter (binary wheels on all
  three platforms; cairosvg, the PR's original choice, needs a native cairo
  runtime that stock Windows lacks), with cairosvg second and the
  Inkscape/ImageMagick fallbacks unchanged. Regression tests pin the
  stock-install invariant.
- **`autoroute` no longer litters the project directory or trusts stale
  output** (#249, scope defined by @Dewieinns' traces). Every run staged its
  `.dsn`/`.ses`/`_best.ses` in the board directory with no cleanup on any of
  its twelve failure exits -- and a leftover `.ses` from an earlier run could
  satisfy the output check and be imported as if freshly routed. Artifacts now
  stage in a per-run temporary directory removed on every exit
  (`keepArtifacts: true` copies them next to the board for debugging), each
  attempt deletes its predecessor's SES before launching so an attempt that
  exits cleanly without writing cannot re-score the previous file, a killed
  subprocess is reported as "terminated externally" instead of raw
  `exit code 4294967295`, and Freerouting's own shared DEBUG log is truncated
  past 5 MB after each run.
- **Python bridge responses are now correlated to their requests by ID**
  (#373, root cause diagnosed exactly by the reporter; implementation adapted
  from @kerby2000's #371). The Node-Python protocol was a single-slot,
  ID-free pipeline: when a request timed out and the next one dispatched, the
  late response resolved the _wrong_ handler -- command B silently received
  command A's result, and every response after that was off by one until the
  next timeout. The reported "no pending request" drops were the visible
  second-order symptom. Requests now carry a bridge-local `requestId` that
  Python echoes back as `_requestId`; stale responses are discarded with a
  log line instead of being delivered to whoever is pending. Timeout
  callbacks only abandon their own request, and partial frames left by a
  timed-out command complete and are discarded by ID rather than corrupting
  the next response.

- **Each server process writes its own log file** (#373, second finding).
  Multiple concurrent servers shared one `kicad_interface.log` through
  rotating handlers; on Windows the rotation collides with the sibling's
  open handle (`WinError 32`). Logs are now per-PID
  (`kicad_interface-<pid>.log`), with a best-effort sweep of logs older than
  seven days so the per-PID naming cannot accumulate without bound.
- **Placed schematic instances inherit the library symbol's Footprint**
  (#300, implementation by @stefangordon in #278). `create_component_instance`
  wrote the caller's `footprint` argument verbatim, defaulted to `""`, so a
  symbol with a perfectly good default footprint placed with an empty one and
  the value survived only in the `lib_symbols` cache. Datasheet and
  Description already inherited two lines above; Footprint now follows the
  same pattern, an explicit argument still wins, and the value flows through
  the escape-aware extractor (#348) and writer (#324) so a footprint
  containing a quote inherits intact.

- **`add_symbol_property` corrupted `.kicad_sym` libraries**. Every call dropped
  one closing paren, so the library stopped loading in eeschema. Eight defects,
  all in the same write path:
  - The rewritten symbol was spliced back as
    `content[:start] + block + content[end + 1:]`, but `block` was sliced
    `[start:end]` — excluding the symbol's closing paren that `end + 1` then
    skipped over. One `)` disappeared per call.
  - The insertion point was matched with `\n\t\t\t(symbol "`, a nesting level
    that does not occur in a `.kicad_sym` file (units sit at two tabs, not
    three). The match never fired, so every new property took the fallback path
    and landed **inside the last unit** instead of on the symbol.
  - Updating an existing property matched `\(property "Name".*?\)` non-greedily,
    which stops at the first `)`. On the multi-line layout eeschema writes, that
    is the `(at ...)` line — the old `(hide yes)` and `(effects ...)` lines were
    left behind as orphans under the symbol.
  - Parens inside quoted values (`"Ceramic (X7R) 50V"`) were counted as
    structure, mis-locating the end of the block.
  - Rewriting a property regenerated a template
    `(effects (font (size 1.27 1.27)))`, discarding the field's real font size,
    thickness, bold/italic and `(justify ...)`. Worse, KiCad 8 and 9 write
    `(hide yes)` _inside_ `(effects ...)`, and only the property's direct
    children were searched — so every hidden field in a KiCad 8/9 library was
    reported visible and un-hidden on the next value edit. On the bundled
    `Simulation_SPICE_minimal.kicad_sym`, updating `Footprint` took the file
    from 16 `(hide yes)` to 15 and updating `Reference` from 5 `(justify ...)`
    to 4.
  - A new property was written _outside_ the symbol when the insertion anchor
    sat on the line that opens the symbol — a compact
    `(symbol "R" (symbol "R_0_1" ...))` or a bare `(symbol "EMPTY")`. The line
    start was computed with `block.rfind("\n", 0, anchor) + 1`, which is 0 when
    there is no preceding newline, and index 0 is the symbol's own `(`. The
    property became a sibling of the symbol; the call reported success and
    `kicad-cli sym upgrade` then exited 2 with `Unable to load library`.
  - An existing property was silently moved to the origin when its `(at ...)`
    used a tab or newline separator (`(at\t5 6 90)`). The test was for the
    literal string `"(at "`, but any whitespace is legal there.
  - The library was read with `Path.read_text` and written with
    `write_text`. Both apply universal-newline translation, so on Windows a
    one-property edit rewrote every line ending in the file; and `write_text`
    truncates in place, so a failure part-way through a multi-megabyte library
    destroyed it.

  Block boundaries are now found by string-aware paren matching, properties are
  resolved and inserted at the symbol's own nesting level (so a unit's
  `Reference` is never mistaken for the symbol's), and values are escaped with
  `escape_sexpr_string`. Indentation is copied from the file being edited rather
  than hardcoded to tabs. Rewriting a property keeps every child it already had
  — its `(at ...)` verbatim, its whole `(effects ...)` block, and its hidden
  state whether that was spelled on the property, nested in `(effects ...)` as
  KiCad 8/9 do, or written as KiCad 7's bare `hide` token — unless `position` or
  `hide` is passed to override it. Writes go to a temporary file that is then
  renamed over the original, preserving the file's existing line-ending style.
  Two guards run before anything reaches disk: the file's paren balance may not
  move, and the property must re-locate as a direct child of the intended symbol
  (balance alone is blind to a well-formed insert at the wrong nesting depth).
  Verified against a 487-symbol library: before the fix, 25 calls left a paren
  balance of +12 and `kicad-cli sym upgrade` reported `Unable to load library`;
  after, the balance is 0 and the library loads. Verified per-property against
  KiCad 10.0.4: round-tripping `Simulation_SPICE_minimal.kicad_sym` through
  `kicad-cli sym upgrade` before and after an edit now yields byte-identical
  output apart from the changed value.

- **JLCPCB yaqwsx source decodes the new `source-db-v2` schema** (#352,
  fixed by @stefanobaldo in #353). Upstream changed the published
  `cache.sqlite3` layout; every part converted with `price_json '[]'` and
  `basic_parts 0`. The converter now reads `jlc_components` joined to
  `lcsc_components`, derives the Basic flag from `library_type = 'base'`,
  and parses the `qFrom-qTo:unitPrice` price encoding, including open-ended
  breaks. Pre-migration caches should be deleted and re-downloaded.

- **`setup-macos.sh --verify` now actually verifies the server can start**
  (#350, fixed by @francisrath in #370). It previously validated `pcbnew`
  but never the Python requirements, so a server that died on
  `import sexpdata` before the MCP handshake still showed all-green.
  `--verify` now import-checks all nine requirements with the same
  interpreter the generated config points at, and `--apply` offers to
  install them. Behavior change: `--verify` exits 1 on missing
  requirements where it previously always exited 0.

- **Instance property writes are now escaped too** (#324, diagnosed by
  @PaulHubiss). The escape-aware _reading_ landed in #348, but the matching
  write side did not: `dynamic_symbol_loader` emitted instance properties raw.

  The two interact badly. Before #348 the reader truncated `power:GND`'s
  Description to a lone backslash; afterwards it correctly returns the real
  value — **with a live quote in it** — which the unescaped writer then emitted
  verbatim. Reading a real stock symbol and writing it back produced **11
  s-expression atoms where there should be 3**, and the value was lost.

  `(property ...)`, `(reference ...)`, `(lib_id ...)` and `(project ...)` on
  written instances, plus the `Sheet name` / `Sheet file` properties in
  `schematic_hierarchy`, all escape through the shared helper now. The
  hierarchy's sheet lookup matches the escaped form as well, so a sheet named
  `Foo "Bar"` is still findable by its plain name.

- **`add_layer` could not add inner copper layers, and corrupted an unrelated
  layer trying** (#222). Four defects, of which the reported one — changes
  never reaching disk — was the least damaging:
  - `add_layer` was missing from the auto-save set, so it reported success and
    wrote nothing.
  - The layer was resolved as `In1_Cu + (number - 1)`, but KiCad's copper layer
    IDs step by **2** (`F.Cu`=0, `B.Cu`=2, `In1.Cu`=4, `In2.Cu`=6). Asking for
    a second inner layer resolved to id 5 — `F.SilkS` — and **renamed the front
    silkscreen layer** to `In2.Cu`. Confirmed against a real KiCad 10.0 install.
  - The copper-layer count was computed as `2 + number`, turning a request for
    two inner layers into six, then eight.
  - `tool_schemas.py` documented a different tool entirely (`layerName` /
    `layerType`) from the one that exists (`name` / `type` / `position` /
    `number`).

  Inner layers are now derived from `SetCopperLayerCount`, which enables and
  canonically names them; a custom name is stored alongside, exactly as KiCad
  writes it (`(4 "In1.Cu" signal "PWR")`). `number` is documented as the
  inner-layer ordinal (1 = In1.Cu) and the response echoes the resolved
  `canonicalName` and `id`, so the interpretation is visible at the call site.
  Non-copper `type` values are now rejected rather than silently retyping
  `F.Cu` — KiCad's technical and user layers are a fixed set.

### Tooling

- **15 symbol-library tools joined the `search_tools` registry** (#345
  progress, @AmirF194 in #359). A new `symbol_library` category registers
  `search_symbols`, `create_symbol`, `add_symbol_property` and 12 more,
  shrinking the frozen unregistered set from 75 to 60. The
  registry-completeness ratchet enforces that the set only shrinks.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-28

A minor bump: **10 new tools** take the registry from 136 to 146, and #343
changes how schematic tools report an unparseable sheet. The headline fix is
#247 — deleting anything from a board used to break the session.

### Breaking Changes

- **Schematic tools now fail loudly on an unparseable schematic** (#343,
  @rossvonfange). Tools that previously returned partial or empty results
  when kicad-skip could not parse a sheet now return a structured error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "schematic_load_failed",
  "flatSymbols": ["LIB:PART"],
  "message": "Schematic load failed for ...: embedded flat lib symbols [...]"
}
```

Affected: `find_orphaned_wires`, hierarchical net traversal, and
`sync_schematic_to_board` among others. This is deliberate — silently
skipping a broken sheet produced an incomplete pad-to-net map reported as
success, which is worse than an error. `flatSymbols` names the offending
symbols, and `repair_flat_symbols` fixes the common cause. See
`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` section 7.

### New Features

- **`import_pcb`**: wraps KiCad 10's native `kicad-cli pcb import` so any MCP
  consumer can convert a vendor PCB file (PADS, Altium, Eagle, CADSTAR,
  Fabmaster, P-CAD, SolidWorks PCB, or a binary Cadence Allegro `.brd`) into
  a `.kicad_pcb` file, with an optional structured import report
  (`reportFormat: "json"|"text"`). Verified against a real 10 MB binary
  Cadence Allegro `.brd` (581 footprints, thousands of net occurrences).
  Binary Allegro `.brd` files must use `format: "auto"` — the CLI's
  `--format` enum has no `"allegro"` literal, auto-detection by magic is the
  only supported path. This tool imports PCB/layout data only; kicad-cli has
  no Concept HDL / OrCAD schematic importer.

- **Hierarchical schematic tools** (#342, @rossvonfange):
  `remove_hierarchical_sheet` (the inverse of `add_hierarchical_sheet` —
  removes the `(sheet ...)` block and its `sheet_instances` page entry, but
  never deletes the sub-sheet file), `set_sheet_property` /
  `get_sheet_properties` for custom sheet metadata, and `hierarchical_place`,
  which arranges footprints by schematic hierarchy using a vendored HierPlace.

- **Schematic authoring and lint tooling** (#343, @rossvonfange):
  `repair_flat_symbols` rewrites SnapEDA/SamacSys symbols that put pins
  directly under the top-level `(symbol ...)` with no `_1_1` sub-unit — legal
  for KiCad, fatal for kicad-skip. `lint_offgrid` reports and optionally snaps
  off-grid connection geometry; a single off-grid endpoint can poison junction
  placement for a whole sheet, because KiCad's connection grid is fixed at
  50 mil and junction matching is exact. `lint_schematic_cosmetic` hides
  duplicate pin names and orients labels away from symbol bodies.

  Both writers default to reporting only (`fix` / `dryRun`), splice bytes
  rather than reformatting the file, and re-parse before writing. Verified
  against a real KiCad 10.0 install: `kicad-cli` still parses the rewritten
  schematic, line counts are unchanged, and a second pass is a no-op.

- **`set_board_origin` / `get_board_origin`** (#341, @rossvonfange) for the
  auxiliary and grid origins.

- **Global labels in batch wiring** (#343, @rossvonfange): `batch_connect` and
  `batch_add_and_connect` take `labelType: "global_label"` for nets that span
  sheets, instead of only sheet-local labels.

### Performance

- **`sync_schematic_to_board` loads each distinct footprint once** (#248).
  The footprint loop called `pcbnew.FootprintLoad` per component with no
  memoization anywhere downstream, so a board with thirteen identical
  resistors paid for thirteen identical disk reads. Each distinct
  `(library, footprint)` is now loaded once and cloned per component.

  On the reporter's measured component mix, warm cache: 29 loads to 6, and
  the loop runs roughly twice as fast. The saving is larger cold, where a
  first read of an untouched `.pretty` dominated everything else.

  Cloning is version-tolerant: `Duplicate()` gained a required argument in
  KiCad 10, and it returns a `BOARD_ITEM` that SWIG does not down-cast, so
  the result is passed through `Cast_to_FOOTPRINT`. Verified against a real
  KiCad 10.0 install.

  Thanks to @Dewieinns for the instrumented per-library timing table, which
  is what showed repeated loads into the same library costing the same as
  the first.

### Bug Fixes

- **`.kicad_pro` net settings survive a board save** (#341, @rossvonfange).
  In a long-lived backend, pcbnew reuses a stale in-memory project model:
  `LoadBoard` does not re-read a hand-edited `.kicad_pro`, and the next save
  serialized that stale model over the file, reverting custom net classes and
  `netclass_patterns` to Default-only. Board saves are now wrapped in a guard
  that restores the on-disk `net_settings` and any dropped top-level keys.
  Opening a project no longer rewrites the file at all — it is a read.

  The guard preserves KiCad's own key order rather than alphabetising, so
  #220's byte-faithful project file survives a restore.

- **`export_schematic_svg` picks the right page** (#343, @rossvonfange).
  kicad-cli emits one SVG per page named after the sheet, and the previous
  code took whichever the filesystem listed first — so a multi-sheet project
  could get an arbitrary sheet back.

- **`delete_schematic_component` can clean up its labels** (#343,
  @rossvonfange). With `deleteAttachedLabels`, net labels sitting on the
  deleted component's pins are removed too, unless still attached to a wire or
  another pin. Orphaned labels otherwise produce `label_dangling` ERC errors.
  Defaults to false, since delete-then-re-add workflows rely on labels
  surviving.

- **Deleting anything from a board no longer breaks the session** (#247).
  `delete_component` worked exactly once. The next board operation — even a
  pure read like `get_component_list` — failed with an `AttributeError`
  naming a raw `SwigPyObject`, and recovery needed a full `close_project`
  then `open_project` cycle.

  The cause was an ownership bug, not a lifetime one. KiCad's SWIG wrapper
  documents that `BOARD.Remove()` _transfers C++ ownership to the Python
  wrapper_ (`item.thisown = 1`) — it is for detaching an item you intend to
  keep or re-add. Six handlers called it to delete and then dropped the
  reference, so the interpreter ran the C++ destructor on an object KiCad
  still pointed at. Reproduced against a real KiCad 10.0 install: the damage
  is **process-wide**, corrupting SWIG's type registry so that even
  `pcbnew.FootprintLoad` degrades to a raw `SwigPyObject` — and on some
  builds the process segfaults outright.

  All deletion now goes through `utils.board_items.delete_board_item()`,
  which uses `BOARD.Delete()` (ownership stays in C++). This fixes
  `delete_component`, `delete_trace` (all three deletion paths),
  `clear_board_outline` and `delete_graphic` — the same defect was present
  in every one. A static test fails the build if bare `board.Remove()` is
  reintroduced.

  Thanks to @Dewieinns for the instrumented trace that made this findable:
  the two errors named _different_ methods (`thisown` on the board path,
  `GetPosition` on the read path), which is what pointed at child proxies
  rather than the board.

- **Board health checks can now see this class of damage** (#247). The
  `_is_board_healthy()` probe tested only BOARD-level methods, so a board
  that dispatched fine while handing back dead child items passed — which is
  precisely why the existing post-save auto-recovery never fired here. It
  now samples a child item as well.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-26

A minor bump rather than a patch: **20 new board-lifecycle and geometry tools**
(#311) take the surface from 124 to 143. The rest is the formatting and
tooling groundwork that #334 deliberately deferred.

### New Features

- **PCB editing interface tools** (#311): 20 tools covering board lifecycle,
  graphics editing and geometry queries — `open_board`, `reload_board`,
  `save_board`, `save_as`, `is_dirty`, `discard_or_reload`,
  `create_board_from_schematic`; `clear_board_outline`,
  `replace_board_outline`, `list_graphics`, `delete_graphic`,
  `update_graphic`, `move_footprint_text`; and `batch_move_components`,
  `get_component_geometry`, `get_pads`, `get_net_pads`, `get_ratsnest`,
  `estimate_airwire_lengths`, `check_placement_clearance`.

  All of them respect backend session pinning (#223), which took three
  rounds to get right and is the reason this landed as carefully as it did.
  `create_board_from_schematic` re-pins after swapping the board, so
  `session_board_path` can no longer point at the previous file;
  `save_board`/`save_as` route through the command dispatcher rather than
  calling the save handler directly, so the dispatcher stays the single
  owner of the pinning decision; and `save_as` additionally realigns both
  the SWIG fallback and the session pin when an IPC save changes the board's
  identity, dropping the stale board outright if that reload fails rather
  than retaining it under the new path. `batch_move_components` refuses in
  an IPC-owned session and points at `move_component`, since the IPC
  BoardAPI exposes only single-component moves.
  `tests/test_backend_session_pinning.py` grew to 32 tests covering each of
  those paths on both backends.

- **Search-tool role distinction** (#338): `search_parts_registry` and
  `search_jlcpcb_parts` now each say when to prefer the other — a verified
  existing footprint/symbol/3D bundle versus JLCPCB sourcing data (price,
  stock, assembly tier). Both were "find me a part" entry points with
  nothing to disambiguate them.

### Tooling

- **Formatting is normalized repo-wide and enforced** (#339): the deferred
  half of #334. `pre-commit run --all-files` (black, isort, prettier,
  flake8, mypy, eslint, whitespace) is now a real gate in CI, which is what
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` has always claimed while nothing checked it. The
  normalization itself touched 31 files — almost entirely `tests/` and
  `src/tools/`, which the old `black --check python/` gate never covered —
  and was verified formatting-only by AST-comparing every changed Python
  file against its predecessor: 16 identical, 5 differing only in import
  order, 0 semantic changes.

  Four latent problems surfaced in the process. The pre-commit mypy hook
  could not resolve `dotenv` (its isolated venv never listed
  `python-dotenv`). `npm run lint` ran `black` in **write** mode against
  whatever `black` was on `PATH` — a global 25.1.0 here, while pre-commit
  pins 26.3.1 — so "linting" silently rewrote the working tree with a
  formatter that disagrees with CI; it now checks only, via `python -m`, with
  `format:py` as the write path and `lint:all` delegating to pre-commit. Two
  more `|| echo`-swallowed gates in the `code-quality` job were replaced with
  real ones. And `mixed-line-ending`'s `--fix=lf` had been in permanent
  conflict with `.gitattributes`' `*.ps1 text eol=crlf` — the hook rewriting
  to LF, git checking back out as CRLF, forever; invisible on Windows because
  `core.autocrlf` masks it, and unfixable on Linux. `.gitattributes` now owns
  line endings for Windows-native scripts.

- **The README's tool count self-corrects** (#338):
  `tests-ts/readme-counts.test.ts` asserts the headline "N tools across M
  categories" matches `getRegistryStats()`. The number had already drifted
  twice. It caught #311 within the hour — `expected 124 to be 143` — which
  is exactly the point.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-26

Eight merges since v2.4.0. The headline is infrastructural: **CI had never
once passed in this repository's history** — 32 failed runs, 0 successes, and
GitHub Actions disabled repo-wide since January — so seven months of merges
landed with no automated gating whatsoever. That is fixed (#334), and it paid
for itself on the first real run by surfacing a live bug: every `create_zone`
call over the IPC backend had been raising `AttributeError`.

Three tools that were registered but had no backend at all now work
(`assign_net_to_class`, `check_clearance`, `set_layer_constraints`), found by
a documentation-coverage audit rather than by anyone using them. Two more
fixes remove silent failures on paths users cannot easily diagnose:
`autoroute` was being abandoned at 30 s while Freerouting was still working,
and `get_board_2d_view` produced no file at all when the caller omitted
`layers`.

Note for anyone tracking `assign_net_to_class`: it did not work on any real
project as first written, because a freshly written `.kicad_pro` carries
`"netclass_assignments": null` and the writer assumed an empty dict. Caught by
a round-trip test across the boundary it shares with #302's DSN exporter —
both sides had green suites that never crossed it.

### New Features

- **Open parts-registry lookup** (#329, closes #297): `search_parts_registry`,
  `get_registry_part` and `download_registry_part` search an open parts
  registry, inspect a part, and fetch its footprint / symbol / 3D files to
  disk — so a verified existing part can be reused instead of generating one
  from scratch with `create_footprint` / `create_symbol`. Downloads are
  host-allowlisted (the API host and its subdomains, or an explicit
  `PARTS_REGISTRY_ASSET_HOSTS` list), extension-checked against the requested
  format, and capped at 50 MB, so a hostile or compromised index cannot
  redirect a fetch to an arbitrary host or dictate an arbitrary filename.

- **Real-time JLCPCB part lookup via the Open Platform API** (#326):
  `get_jlcpcb_part` now returns live stock, tiered pricing and library type
  when `JLCPCB_APP_ID` / `JLCPCB_API_KEY` / `JLCPCB_API_SECRET` are configured
  (see `.env.example`). Credentials are optional: without them — or on any API
  error — the tool falls back to the existing local snapshot database, and the
  response carries `source: "live-api" | "local-db"` so callers can tell which
  path answered. Part _search_ remains local-only.

### Tooling

- **CI actually gates the Python suite now** (#334): the `python-tests` job had
  been a no-op in four independent ways — every gate ended in
  `|| echo "... not configured yet"`, `pytest python/` pointed at the source
  tree so it collected 7 tests instead of the ~1477 in `tests/`, no JRE was
  installed for the freerouting suites, and GitHub Actions was disabled
  repo-wide so the workflow never ran at all (32 failed runs, 0 successes,
  switched off in January). Format and type checks now run once on a pinned
  interpreter rather than once per matrix entry, because `pip install black`
  resolves a different build per Python version (black >=25.12 requires
  > =3.10, so the 3.9 runner silently got 25.1.0 and disagreed on three files).

### Bug Fixes

- **Saving to the board's own path was silently treated as a Save As, and
  failed on the IPC backend**: `save_board` accepts an optional `boardPath`, and
  callers routinely echo the currently loaded path back into it. That path was
  forwarded unconditionally as `save_params["filename"]`, so `_ipc_save_project`
  saw a `destination` and called `ipc_backend.save_project(path, overwrite=False)`
  → `board.save_as(current_path, overwrite=False)`. The KiCad IPC API separates
  `save()` from `save_as(filename, overwrite=False)`, where `save_as` targets a
  _new_ file and refuses a destination that already exists unless `overwrite` is
  set — and the board's own file always exists, so an ordinary save could fail.
  SWIG never hit this because it compared `filename` against the board's current
  path and fell through to a plain `SaveBoard`, which made the identical call
  succeed on one backend and fail on the other. The destination is now compared
  against the authoritative board path before dispatch and dropped when they
  name the same file, with the same collapse repeated defensively inside
  `_handle_save_project` and `_ipc_save_project`. Real Save As to a different
  path is unchanged, including its `overwrite` gate.
- **Save As path comparison could misjudge the same file on Windows**:
  `ProjectCommands.save_project()` compared `os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(...))`
  strings directly. On Windows `C:\Project\Board.kicad_pcb` and
  `c:\project\board.kicad_pcb` name one file but compare unequal, so a
  differently cased spelling of the loaded board was classified as a Save As and
  then rejected because the destination existed and `overwrite` defaulted to
  False. Comparisons now go through a new `commands.project.normalize_fs_path`
  helper (`normcase` + `realpath` + `abspath`, matching the normalization
  `KiCADInterface` already used for session paths), which also resolves symlinks
  and `..` segments. Normalization is used only for comparing; the path actually
  written is still the board's own, so symlinks stay intact. Unlikely to show up
  in Linux CI, but it affected real Windows users.

- **`assign_net_to_class` and `check_clearance` now actually work — both were
  registered MCP tools with no backend** (#315): found while auditing
  DRC/design-rule documentation coverage. Both had a full Zod schema in
  `design-rules.ts` and were listed in the router's `drc` category, but neither
  had an entry in `kicad_interface.py`'s command dispatch table, so every call
  silently returned `{"success": false, "message": "Unknown command: ..."}`.
  `assign_net_to_class` now assigns an existing net to an existing net class,
  mirroring `create_netclass`'s dual-write shape (best-effort in-memory
  `NETINFO_ITEM.SetClass` plus a durable write to the project's
  `net_settings.netclass_assignments`, since KiCad 7+ keeps net-class
  membership in `.kicad_pro`, not the board — same reasoning as #302, and the
  same key `utils/project_netclasses.py` already reads back for DSN export).
  `check_clearance` resolves two items by UUID (or reference, for components)
  and measures the gap between their bounding boxes against the board's
  minimum clearance — the same AABB approximation `check_courtyard_overlaps`
  already uses, not a substitute for a full `run_drc`. Also removed the dead
  duplicate `add_net_class` tool (it overlapped with the already-working
  `create_netclass`, which had more capability than its own TS schema exposed —
  `create_netclass` now also accepts `uviaDiameter`, `uviaDrill`,
  `diffPairWidth`, `diffPairGap`, and `nets`).

- **`set_layer_constraints` now actually works — it was a registered MCP tool
  with no backend**: found during the same DRC-tool audit as
  `assign_net_to_class`/`check_clearance`. Had a full Zod schema in
  `design-rules.ts` and was listed in the router's `drc` category, but had no
  entry in `kicad_interface.py`'s command dispatch table, so every call
  silently returned `{"success": false, "message": "Unknown command: set_layer_constraints"}`.
  Unlike the other two DRC gaps, there is no pcbnew SWIG API for per-layer
  constraints at all (confirmed against the real KiCad 10 bindings) — real
  per-layer minimums in KiCad 9+ live in a project-scoped
  `.kicad_dru` custom-rules text file (S-expression DSL), sibling to the
  `.kicad_pcb`, which `kicad-cli pcb drc` auto-discovers with no flag needed.
  New `python/utils/kicad_dru.py` does a surgical text edit — insert or
  replace a `(rule "mcp_layer_constraint_<layer>" ...)` block by name,
  leaving any other rules, comments, and formatting in the file untouched —
  rather than a full parse/reserialize. Verified against real KiCad 10
  (`kicad-cli pcb drc` on a real demo board with a deliberately strict rule):
  all four constraint types (`track_width`, `clearance`, `via_diameter`,
  `hole_size`) are recognized and enforced, with violations citing the rule
  by name.

- **IPC `create_zone` assigned a read-only property** (found by #334 on its
  first real run): kipy's `Zone.fill_mode` is a read-only property — its getter
  reads `_proto.copper_settings.fill_mode` and there is no setter — so
  `zone.fill_mode = ...` raised `AttributeError` and every `create_zone` call
  over the IPC backend failed. It stayed hidden because kipy is absent from a
  bare dev environment, where mypy types `Zone` as `Any`; CI installs
  `requirements.txt`, sees the real type, and flags it. Now writes through the
  proto, the same way the zone outline already did.

- **`autoroute` no longer times out at 30 s** (#251): `autoroute` was missing
  from the Node bridge's long-running command list, so the call was abandoned
  after the 30 s default while the Python side was still working through its
  own 300 s budget — on any board past ~20 nets the tool reported failure
  against a `.ses` that existed and was valid. Its timeout is now derived from
  the caller's own parameters (`attempts × timeout` plus overhead, floored at
  the blanket allowance) rather than a fixed ceiling, since `timeout` is
  per-attempt and best-of-N multiplies it. The policy moved to
  `src/command-timeout.ts` as a pure function so it is unit-testable.

- **`get_board_2d_view` always passes `--layers`** (#235): the flag was omitted
  entirely when the caller specified no layers, and KiCad 9+ then refuses the
  export — verified against real KiCad 10, which prints "At least one layer
  must be specified" and writes no file, so the tool silently produced nothing.
  Defaults to copper + both silkscreens + `Edge.Cuts`. (Cherry-picked from
  #277, authored by Stefan Gordon.)

- **Two Windows-only test assertions made genuinely cross-platform**: a
  `normcase` case-folding assumption and a hardcoded `\` path separator, both
  of which could never pass on Linux runners.

- **`replace_schematic_component` no longer corrupts `lib_symbols` while
  restoring fields**: the post-replace field restore ran a `count=1` regex
  substitution over the whole file, so the first matching
  `(property "<name>" ...)` in the document was rewritten — for common field
  names like `Description` that is a library symbol definition inside
  `lib_symbols`, not the replaced component (observed corrupting an unrelated
  `Conn_01x04` entry and tripping ERC library-mismatch warnings on every
  instance). Restoration now delegates to the block-scoped
  `edit_schematic_component` path, which also creates fields that the new
  symbol does not carry yet instead of silently dropping them.

- **`delete_schematic_net_label` refuses ambiguous bare-name deletes**:
  without a `position`, `WireManager.delete_label` silently removed the first
  label matching the name — dangerous when the same net name appears many
  times (and easy to trigger, since misspelled top-level `x`/`y` arguments are
  stripped by schema validation and arrive as `position=None`). A bare-name
  delete of a name that occurs more than once now fails with the full list of
  candidate positions so the caller can disambiguate; unique names and
  position-qualified deletes behave as before.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-22

Eighteen merges since v2.3.1. Four new tool families land — symbol library
management, symbol property editing, `lib_id` replacement for library
migration, and update-from-library refresh — alongside a process-wide caching
layer for symbol discovery that removes repeated multi-MB library re-reads.
Two fixes restore basic operation for whole classes of users: every
`.kicad_sym` and schematic write was broken on the project's declared Python
3.9 floor (#328), and JLCPCB part search could not find hyphenated MPNs
(#327). Eagle import now writes KiCad 10 headers (#330), closing the last of
the stale-format leftovers from the #221 scaffolding work.

### Performance

- **Module-level caches for symbol library discovery, resolution, and
  extraction** (#299): a fresh `DynamicSymbolLoader` is created for every
  `add_schematic_component` call and a fresh `SymbolLibraryManager` (with its
  warm-up thread) for every `KiCADInterface`, so instance-level caches never
  survived — each component add re-scanned the sym-lib-table and re-read
  multi-MB `.kicad_sym` files, and each interface construction re-parsed all
  installed libraries on its own thread (super-linear cost across the test
  suite). Library directories, resolved library paths, extracted symbol
  blocks, and parsed symbol lists are now cached process-wide. Staleness
  guards, because libraries are NOT immutable mid-session (`create_symbol`,
  `delete_symbol`, `add_symbol_property`, `register_symbol_library`):
  resolution misses are never cached, resolved paths are revalidated with
  `exists()`, block/list entries carry the source file's `mtime_ns`, and the
  mutating write paths explicitly clear the caches. Tests can skip the
  speculative warm-up via `KICAD_SKIP_SYMBOL_WARMUP=1`.

### New Features

- **Library management tools: `import_symbol`, `export_symbol`,
  `rename_symbol`** — copy a symbol between `.kicad_sym` libraries (with
  optional rename/overwrite; target created if missing), extract one symbol
  to a standalone file, and rename a symbol including its sub-symbol shards
  and any `(extends ...)` references from derived symbols in the same
  library. Deletion deliberately stays with the existing `delete_symbol`
  tool — one tool per capability. All three writes invalidate the
  module-level symbol caches, and new/exported files reuse SymbolCreator's
  header token so every `.kicad_sym` this server writes carries the same,
  oldest-supported format version.

- **`replace_instance_lib_ids` tool** — library-migration primitive: swaps
  `lib_id` references in schematic symbol instances per an explicit
  old-to-new mapping (values used verbatim, so one migration may target
  several libraries), with automatic angle correction for the Eagle
  importer's mirror-variant suffixes (`__m0`/`__m90`/`__m180`/`__m270`).
  Instances only — the `lib_symbols` section is preserved;
  `update_symbol_from_library` refreshes definitions afterwards. Matching
  logic (which symbol replaces which) deliberately stays with the caller.

- **Symbol property tools** (#308): `add_symbol_property` adds or updates a
  custom property (Manufacturer, MPN, LCSC, ...) on a symbol in a
  `.kicad_sym` library file — the durable, library-wide path for BOM fields.
  `add_library_symbol_property` does the same on a symbol definition in a
  schematic's `lib_symbols` cache; note those cache edits are overwritten by
  a later `update_symbol_from_library` refresh, so the tool descriptions
  steer callers to the library-file tool first.

- **`update_symbol_from_library` tool** (#291): refresh the cached
  `lib_symbols` definitions in one schematic, a list of schematics, or every
  project under a directory from the current `.kicad_sym` library — the
  programmatic equivalent of KiCad's Update Symbol from Library. Placed
  instances are preserved (per-pin uuids, references, `instances` blocks);
  power symbols have their `(power)` wrapper flattened to the schematic
  layout; mirror-cache symbols (`__m0`, `__m90`, ...) are skipped, with an
  optional `repairMirrorFromBackup` to restore them from a pre-update
  backup. Writes go through the canonical formatter.

### Tooling

- **pathlib migration, first slice**: `kicad_interface.py` and
  `schematic_handlers.py` now use `pathlib.Path` for file-path handling
  (`os.path.normcase` remains in `_normalize_board_path` — it has no pathlib
  equivalent). Values crossing into JSON responses and subprocess argv stay
  `str`. Also strips a stray UTF-8 BOM from `commands/export.py` and bumps
  mypy's `python_version` to 3.10 — required by current mypy, which dropped
  the 3.9 target (note: the project's declared `requires-python = ">=3.9"`
  floor is therefore no longer verified by the type checker). `export.py`
  and the remaining `os.path` call sites are follow-up slices.

- **Interface construction smoke test**: a new test constructs
  `KiCADInterface` with the stubbed pcbnew and asserts every
  `command_routes` entry is callable, every schema-listed tool has a route,
  and recently-added tools are present. A route entry referencing a renamed
  or un-imported handler function passes every module-level test but
  crashes the server at startup with `NameError` (#308 shipped exactly
  that); this makes the class unshippable.

### Bug Fixes

- **Eagle import writes KiCad 10 schematic headers** (#330, closes #321): the
  Eagle importer still stamped the KiCad 9 token `(version 20250114)` on every
  `.kicad_sch` it generated — the same stale token #221 removed from the
  project scaffolding path, left behind because the importer has its own
  writer. Generated schematics now carry the canonical KiCad 10 header,
  byte-identical to the string `python/commands/schematic.py` and
  `python/commands/project.py` already write, and the Eagle symbol-library
  writer reuses `KICAD9_SYMBOL_LIB_VERSION` from `symbol_creator.py` rather
  than a third hardcoded literal, so every `.kicad_sym` this server emits now
  tracks one constant. Verified against real `kicad-cli` 10.0 rather than
  string assertions alone: the importer's output exports to PDF and passes
  ERC. The now-unused `KICAD9_FORMAT_VERSION` constant and a broken standalone
  `ComponentManager` demo block are removed. Seed templates under
  `python/templates/` intentionally keep `20250114` — their header is
  rewritten at write time, and existing tests assert the stale token never
  reaches written output.

- **`.kicad_sym` and schematic writes work again on Python 3.9** (#328): the
  library-management (`import_symbol`/`export_symbol`/`rename_symbol`), Eagle
  prettify, and symbol-schematic writers introduced with the recent tooling
  wrote files via `Path.write_text(content, newline="\n")`, but
  `Path.write_text` did not accept the `newline` keyword until Python 3.10 —
  so on the project's declared `>=3.9` floor every one of those calls raised
  `TypeError: write_text() got an unexpected keyword argument 'newline'`. Each
  site now opens the file handle explicitly with an `open("w", ...)` call that
  passes `newline="\n"` and writes through it, preserving the forced LF line
  ending (so the files stay byte-identical on Windows rather than emitting
  CRLF) while running on 3.9.

- **JLCPCB part search finds hyphenated MPNs** (#327): `search_parts` built
  its FTS5 `MATCH` query by appending `*` to each whitespace term, so a real
  manufacturer part number like `SHT41-AD1F-R2` became `SHT41-AD1F-R2*` — and
  FTS5 reads `-` as a column/NOT operator, raising
  `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: AD1F`. `search_parts` wraps the
  query in a broad `except` that returns `[]`, so searching by an exact MPN
  silently found nothing instead of erroring. Each term is now emitted as a
  quoted prefix phrase (`"term"*`) with any embedded double quote doubled, so
  hyphens and other FTS punctuation are matched as literal text; plain prefix
  matching (`SHT41` still matches the full MPN) is unchanged. A regression test
  builds a tiny in-schema FTS database and pins both the pre-fix crash and the
  fixed lookup.

- **`add_schematic_component` snaps the placement origin to the 1.27 mm
  (50 mil) schematic connection grid** (#299): library pins sit at integer
  multiples of 1.27 mm from the symbol origin, so an off-grid origin leaves
  every pin off-grid — wires and net labels cannot bind electrically, ERC
  reports `endpoint_off_grid`, and the netlist comes up empty. The snap is
  always on; the handler response reports the actual `placed_at` position
  (looked up by reference, so multiple instances of the same symbol report
  correctly) plus `snapped: true` and `requested_at` when the coordinates
  were adjusted. Snapped values are written with at most two decimals —
  exact for every multiple of 1.27 — instead of raw float products.

- **`sync_schematic_to_board` no longer re-parses the fp-lib-table on every
  call** (#248): `_add_missing_footprints_from_schematic` built a fresh
  `LibraryManager` — re-parsing the global and project `fp-lib-table` files,
  recursively following any `Table` references — on every single invocation.
  In an iterative rebuild flow (call `sync_schematic_to_board`, tweak the
  schematic, call it again), that overhead was paid again each time even
  though the project hadn't changed. The interface now caches the
  `LibraryManager` via `_get_project_library_manager`, keyed on the project
  directory plus the mtimes of the fp-lib-table files it parses, so the
  cache is reused across repeat calls but rebuilds automatically when a
  table changes (e.g. `register_footprint_library`, or a KiCad GUI edit
  mid-session).

- **Fixed a test-suite state leak that caused spurious pin-position failures
  when test files ran in combination** (#287): `tests/test_rotate_schematic_mirror.py`
  installed a throwaway `MagicMock` at `sys.modules["commands.pin_locator"]`
  via `sys.modules.setdefault(...)` at module-collection time, with no
  teardown. Any later-collected file relying on the real
  `commands.pin_locator` (e.g. `WireDragger.get_pin_defs`, via
  `commands.wire_dragger`) silently got empty pin data instead of an error —
  iterating a bare `MagicMock()` is a no-op by default. A `teardown_module`
  now undoes the stub, and `test_rotate_handler_no_crash`'s stubbed
  `kicad_interface.py` exec additionally evicts any `commands.*` submodule it
  imported for the first time while `pcbnew`/`skip` were mocked, so later
  tests get a clean re-import instead of a module bound to a discarded mock.
  Test-only change; no production code touched.

- **`import_ses` no longer creates phantom slashless nets — routed tracks bind
  to the real board nets** (#246): KiCad global-label nets are named with a
  leading `/` (e.g. `/GND`), but a Specctra DSN round-trip through Freerouting
  can drop that prefix. `ImportSpecctraSES` then fails its exact-string net
  lookup and creates a _new_ slashless net (`GND`), leaving `/GND` unconnected
  and every routed track flagged by DRC. `import_ses` now reconciles the SES
  before import: a pure `_reconcile_ses_net_names` re-adds the `/` to any
  `(net "NAME" …)` token that matches a board net only when prefixed (idempotent;
  names that genuinely have no slash on the board are left untouched), and the
  repaired copy is imported. Any reconciliation error falls back to importing the
  original file unchanged; the response reports `netsRemapped`.

- **`add_sheet_pin` finds sheets regardless of line formatting; sheet/text
  insertion no longer splices mid-line** (#298): `add_hierarchical_sheet`
  and the wire/label/text insert helper located their insertion point with
  `content.rfind(...)` — a raw character offset — so on files where the
  marker does not start its own line (sexpdata-written schematics keep
  several forms on one line) the new block landed mid-line. `add_sheet_pin`
  then scanned line-by-line for `(sheet` at the start of a line and could
  never find such a sheet, failing with "sheet not found" on a sheet that
  plainly existed. Insertions now snap to a line boundary (breaking the
  line when the marker shares it), and `add_sheet_pin` scans by character
  with paren matching, so it also works on files already written with
  mid-line sheets and on fully minified single-line schematics.

- **`export_dsn`/`autoroute` no longer drop `.kicad_pro` net classes — power
  nets keep their width** (#302): net-class definitions live in the project
  file on KiCad 7+, which the headless `pcbnew.LoadBoard()` path never reads,
  so `ExportSpecctraDSN` exported every net under a single `kicad_default`
  class at Default width/clearance. The one-call `autoroute` tool re-exports
  internally, so a 2.0 mm power net was silently handed to Freerouting at
  0.2 mm signal width. Both tools now rebuild the board's `NET_SETTINGS` from
  `.kicad_pro` (`net_settings.classes`, `netclass_patterns`, and
  `netclass_assignments`, via a new `python/utils/project_netclasses.py`)
  before exporting, so KiCad's own exporter natively emits per-class
  `(class ...)` blocks, rules, and via padstacks — verified against real
  KiCad 10 to match a project-loaded GUI export. The tool result now carries
  a `netClasses` report (`applied` classes, or a `warning` when no project
  file is found or the classes cannot be applied), so a dropped class is
  loud instead of silent.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-05

Eight merges since v2.3.0: the entire June scaffolding cluster (#220/#221/
#242/#243) is closed, KiCad install discovery is unified across all Windows
code paths, derived symbols in `.kicad_symdir` libraries resolve correctly,
and three new feature areas land (Eagle import, 3D model tools, interactive
schematic reload). A critical compatibility fix ensures generated schematics
load on every KiCad 10.0.x build.

### New Features

- **Eagle schematic import** (#285): `import_eagle_schematic` converts Eagle
  `.sch` XML designs to KiCad `.kicad_sch` format — symbol mapping, net
  wires, labels, junctions, multi-gate parts (combined into multi-unit KiCad
  symbols). Dangling-wire pruning trims isolated stubs; a ground-truth ERC
  check via `kicad-cli` reports the real error/warning counts so callers see
  KiCad's numbers, not the importer's internal model.

- **3D model tools** (#263): `add_component_3d_model` and
  `remove_component_3d_model` attach/detach STEP/WRL 3D models to footprints
  with offset, rotation, and scale. Respects backend session pinning.

- **Opt-in interactive schematic reload on Windows** (#208): set
  `KICAD_INTERACTIVE_SCHEMATIC=1` and schematic-writing tools will
  auto-confirm KiCad's "file changed — reload?" dialog so the editor stays
  in sync. PID-scoped, title-keyword-matched (not generic "Confirmation"
  dialogs), and never clicks Discard/Unsaved buttons.

- **User environment variables from `kicad_common.json`** (#292): the
  `${VARIABLE}` placeholders KiCad users define in Preferences are now
  resolved when expanding library paths, so custom env-var-based library
  setups work out of the box.

### Bug Fixes

- **`get_wire_connections` locates pins correctly on rotated symbols**:
  `_find_pins_on_net` computed pin world coordinates with a local transform
  that applied mirror before rotation, diverging from `WireDragger.pin_world_xy`
  (the shared transform corrected in #259) for 90 and 270 degree rotations. Pins
  on rotated symbols were placed at the wrong coordinate and dropped from their
  own net's pin list (observed on an LM324 whose gates are placed rotated 90:
  eight of its pins went missing from their nets). `_find_pins_on_net` now calls
  `pin_world_xy` so pin geometry matches eeschema everywhere. Single-unit and
  unrotated parts are unaffected.

- **`get_wire_connections` no longer reports phantom cross-unit pins** (#293):
  `_find_pins_on_net` transformed every unit's pins against every placed
  instance of a multi-unit component, so a sibling unit's pin whose library
  offset matched could land on this instance's wire and be reported as a
  false member of the net (e.g. an LM358's pin 7 appearing on unit A's
  output net alongside pin 1). `_parse_symbol_instances_sexp` now records
  each instance's `(unit N)`, and `_find_pins_on_net` filters the pin
  definitions to that unit (plus unit 0, common to all units) before
  transforming them. Complements #272, which fixed the query-coordinate side
  of the same multi-unit gap; the pin `unit` tags it added are what this fix
  consumes. Single-unit parts are unaffected.

- **KiCad install discovery is unified and finds relocated Windows installs**
  (#286): `kicad-cli` resolution, symbol/python-path discovery, and footprint-dir
  lookup each independently assumed KiCad lived under `C:\Program Files\KiCad`, so
  a custom install root (the installer allows any; short roots like
  `C:\KiCad\10.0` are common) got degraded discovery in three different ways. A
  new shared helper `python/utils/kicad_roots.py` yields KiCad install roots
  newest-version first from the Windows registry uninstall keys
  (`InstallLocation`, authoritative for wherever the user installed), the
  `C:\Program Files\KiCad\*` / `(x86)` globs, and common custom roots
  (`C:\KiCad\*`), de-duplicated and cached per-process. `utils/kicad_cli.py`,
  `utils/platform_helper.py`, `commands/library.py` (footprints), and
  `commands/library_symbol.py` (symbols) now build their Windows paths from it, so
  discovery
  can no longer drift apart (the same unification #267 did for the three
  `kicad-cli` resolvers). macOS/Linux behavior is unchanged.

- **Derived symbols in KiCad 10 `.kicad_symdir` libraries now inline their parent**
  (#282): in the sharded directory format each symbol is its own
  `<Symbol>.kicad_sym` file, so a symbol using `(extends "Parent")` has its parent
  in a _sibling_ shard. `extract_symbol_from_library` handed only the child's shard
  to the inliner, so the parent was never found and the `(extends)` clause was
  stripped — producing a symbol shell with no parent pins/graphics (e.g.
  `Device:Filter_EMI_C`, which extends `C_Feedthrough`). A new
  `_resolve_symdir_extends` reads the parent shard, resolves it recursively (a
  parent may itself extend a grandparent in another shard), and merges it via the
  existing single-level inliner; a missing parent shard still degrades gracefully
  (strips + warns, keeping the file loadable). Single-file `.kicad_sym` libraries
  are unaffected.

- **New projects and schematics start blank instead of seeding `_TEMPLATE_*`
  symbols** (#221, #243): `create_project` and `create_schematic` copied
  `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch` / `template_with_symbols.kicad_sch`,
  which pre-seeded `Device:R/C/LED` `lib_symbols` and placed `_TEMPLATE_*`
  instances into every new file. Those symbols existed only as clone sources for
  the legacy `ComponentManager.add_component` path; the live
  `add_schematic_component` tool synthesizes its own `lib_symbols` via the
  dynamic loader (and the legacy fallback was removed in #288), so the seeds only
  leaked into user files. Both tools now copy a new blank KiCad 10 template
  (`python/templates/blank.kicad_sch`: `(version 20260101) (generator "eeschema")`,
  empty `lib_symbols`, no placed symbols).
  `template_with_symbols.kicad_sch` is kept unchanged in-repo as a test fixture.
  A regression test asserts a created schematic contains no `_TEMPLATE_`
  references and no seeded `lib_symbols` entries.

- **Generated schematics use format version `20260101`, not `20260306`, so
  every KiCad 10.0.x can open them**: KiCad refuses to load files that claim
  a format version newer than the running build, and `20260306` is a later
  10.0.x token — KiCad 10.0.0 (whose `kicad-cli sch upgrade` writes
  `20260101`) reported "Failed to load schematic" on our output. All
  templates, fallback writers, and test fixtures now use `20260101`, which
  loads on every 10.0.x (newer builds silently upgrade on save). This also
  makes `tests/fixtures/canonical_schematic.kicad_sch` loadable by
  `kicad-cli`, which it previously was not.

- **`create_project` writes a conformant KiCad 10 `.kicad_pro`** (#220): the
  project file was a hand-rolled 122-byte stub containing only
  `board.filename` and a `sheets` entry with the literal id `"root"`, so
  KiCad regenerated defaults on open and discarded any intended
  configuration. A new writer (`python/utils/kicad_project.py`) emits the
  full structure KiCad 10 itself produces for a new project — captured from
  pcbnew's own `SETTINGS_MANAGER.SaveProject()` output (`meta.version 3`,
  all twelve sections, the stock Default net class) — with `sheets` carrying
  the real schematic root-sheet UUID. Verified against real KiCad 10:
  `SETTINGS_MANAGER.LoadProject` opens the generated file, and project ERC
  runs clean.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-03

The first tagged release. Highlights: both KiCad 10 schematic-corruption
mechanisms are fixed (incomplete instance blocks and minified single-line
writes — #256), the SWIG/IPC backend is pinned per loaded project so edits
can no longer be lost to silent backend switching (#223), saves refuse to
clobber external file edits (#244), and the entire cli-tool family works on
stock Windows installs where KiCad is not on PATH.

Behavior changes to note when upgrading from 2.2.3: `rotate_component`
treats `angle` as an absolute target (previously additive over IPC);
`save_project` can now return `success: false` with
`diskChangedExternally: true` instead of overwriting (pass `force: true`
for the old behavior); and a session loaded on SWIG stays on SWIG even when
the KiCad GUI connects later (reopen the project to adopt IPC).

### Tooling

- **TypeScript test scaffolding (Vitest)**: `npm run test:ts` now runs a real
  Vitest suite instead of the placeholder echo. Starter coverage lives in
  `tests-ts/` and exercises the pure-function modules `src/tools/registry.ts`
  (categories, direct vs. routed classification, search, and stats invariants)
  and `src/tools/tool-response.ts` (`formatKicadResult` success/error shaping).
  Use `npm run test:ts:watch` for the watch-mode REPL. The CI `typescript-tests`
  job now invokes the suite directly instead of swallowing failures.

- **Version sync**: `package.json` now reports `2.2.3`, matching the released
  version documented in this changelog and in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Previously it
  was stuck at `2.1.0-alpha`.

### Bug Fixes

- **Placed symbols get complete KiCad 10 instance blocks — no more crash on
  drag/edit** (#256, first half): `create_component_instance` was rewritten
  into a full KiCad 10 instance writer. Components placed via
  `add_schematic_component` / `batch_add_components` now carry the real
  project name (from the `.kicad_pro`), the real root-sheet uuid path instead
  of `(path "/")`, per-pin `(pin "N" (uuid ...))` entries (also fixes #241 —
  ERC can bind wires to pins), and the complete field set in canonical order.
  Verified structurally identical to eeschema's own output by round-tripping
  through `kicad-cli sch upgrade`. Previously the incomplete blocks made
  KiCad crash when a placed symbol was dragged or edited.

- **Schematic writes emit KiCad's canonical multi-line format, never a
  minified single line** (#256, second half): every schematic write tool
  serialized through `sexpdata.dumps()`, which emits the whole file as one
  line — producing unreviewable diffs, whole-file churn against eeschema
  saves, and in the worst reports unrecoverable projects. A faithful port of
  KiCad's `Prettify()` (`python/utils/sexpr_format.py`) now formats all tool
  writes byte-identically to eeschema's "Save"; every write re-parses its own
  output and falls back to the exact compact form on any mismatch, so the
  formatter can never corrupt data. `scripts/kicad_sch_reformat.py` repairs
  files minified by older versions.

- **Dragging/rotating a symbol now carries coincident net labels with the
  moved pins**: labels sitting exactly on a moved pin were left behind and
  could silently re-net onto a neighbouring signal (invisible until the
  netlist diverged). `drag_wires` gains a third pass that relocates
  `label`/`global_label`/`hierarchical_label` with the same tolerance used
  for wire endpoints; move/rotate responses report `labelsMoved`.

- **Pin positions and wire-stub angles are correct for rotated+mirrored
  symbols**: `pin_world_xy` applied mirror before rotation, and the outward
  pin angle was hand-derived in a way that was 180° wrong for horizontal
  pins. Both are fixed and locked in by a netlist oracle that validates the
  full rotation × mirror matrix against real eeschema output.

- **KiCad 10 sheet-rename compatibility**: the sheet-rename path only matched
  the KiCad 7–9 file format ("Sheetname" property, tab indentation), so it
  was a silent no-op on KiCad 10 schematics; the matcher now accepts both
  formats. NC template phantom pins are also cleaned up.

- **KiCad 10 `.kicad_symdir` sharded symbol libraries are discovered**
  (Windows/Linux/macOS): symbol search and schematic placement now resolve
  libraries stored in KiCad 10's directory-sharded format, not just
  monolithic `.kicad_sym` files.

- **`kicad-cli` is resolved robustly instead of failing when not on PATH**:
  KiCad's Windows installer does not add its `bin` to PATH, so every
  cli-backed tool (exports, ERC/DRC, netlist, board views) failed with a bare
  "kicad-cli not found in PATH". A centralized resolver
  (`python/utils/kicad_cli.py`) now tries `$KICAD_CLI` (fails loudly if set
  but invalid), the running interpreter's directory, PATH, and known per-OS
  install locations — and failures list every location tried. The three
  drifted `_find_kicad_cli` copies are unified onto it.

- **7-Zip is resolved the same way, and the yaqwsx JLCPCB download works on a
  stock install**: the split-archive volume count is auto-detected (the
  hardcoded cap of 30 silently truncated newer archives), and the 7z CLI is
  found via `$SEVEN_ZIP`/PATH/known install dirs instead of PATH-only.

- **File-answerable reads fall back to SWIG when the live KiCad has no
  document open**: `get_board_info`/`get_component_properties` routed to the
  realtime IPC backend even when the GUI had nothing loaded, returning
  misleading "not found" results or a false-success zeroed payload with an
  embedded error. Such reads are now re-served from the on-disk board and
  tagged `_backend: "swig"` with an explanatory note; genuine misses are
  distinguished from the no-document case.

- **SWIG pcbnew is imported even when IPC connects at startup**: an
  IPC-connected session that later downgraded to SWIG (GUI closed or busy)
  hit "name 'pcbnew' is not defined", surfaced as a bogus "dehydrated SWIG
  proxy" error. pcbnew is now imported whenever it isn't explicitly disabled,
  and a missing pcbnew is fatal only when there is no working IPC backend.

- **IPC connect attempts are bounded** (default 5s, `KICAD_IPC_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`):
  kipy dials with no timeout, so a busy KiCad GUI (modal dialog, library
  reload) could hang connects for minutes; they now fail fast and fall back
  to SWIG. The underlying IPC socket is also closed explicitly on disconnect,
  stopping a file-descriptor leak in long-lived reconnecting sessions.

- **`save_project` no longer silently clobbers external file edits** (#244):
  the explicit save wrote `pcbnew.SaveBoard` unconditionally, so a direct edit
  to the `.kicad_pcb` made after the MCP loaded the board (e.g. a manual
  net-name patch after a Freerouting import) was destroyed without warning —
  and the dispatcher then re-recorded the disk signature, blessing the
  clobber. The explicit path now applies the same content-hash divergence
  check the auto-save path already had: a diverged file refuses the save with
  `diskChangedExternally: true` and instructions (reload via `open_project`,
  or pass `force=true` to overwrite). Saving to a different `filename` is an
  explicit destination choice and is never blocked. `close_project`'s
  save-before-close routes through the same guard.

- **Legacy `ComponentManager.add_component` no longer silently loses
  components via dynamic template injection** (#221, part B): when no placed
  `_TEMPLATE_*` donor existed, the legacy clone path used to call
  `DynamicSymbolLoader.load_symbol_dynamically`, which wrote a template
  instance into the _file_ mid-call and cloned onto a locally reloaded
  object — so callers following the normal add-then-save pattern saved
  their stale in-memory schematic, discarding the new component and
  leaving `_TEMPLATE_*` clutter behind. That branch is removed: template
  lookup is now read-only (`find_template`), a schematic without donors
  gets a clear error pointing at the production `add_schematic_component`
  path (which works on any file), and the fixture-based clone path is
  unchanged. `add_component` is deprecated for general use; the
  remove/update/get/search helpers are unaffected.

- **Pin locations respect the owning unit of multi-unit symbols** (#239):
  `get_schematic_pin_locations` / `get_pin_location` located every pin against
  whichever placed `(symbol)` instance appeared first in file order, so for a
  multi-unit part (e.g. a dual op-amp placed as separate units at different
  positions) all pins collapsed onto that one unit's coordinates. Pins are now
  tagged with their owning unit while parsing `lib_symbols` (the
  `<name>_<unit>_<body>` sub-symbol), and each pin is located against the placed
  instance carrying the matching `(unit N)` — with rotation/mirror read from that
  same instance. Single-unit parts are unaffected (they fall back to the first
  instance as before).

- **Fallback schematic writer emits the KiCad 10 header** (#221, partial): the
  template-missing fallback in `create_schematic` and `create_project` wrote the
  stale KiCad 9 header `(version 20250114) (generator "KiCAD-MCP-Server")`. It
  now writes `(version 20260306) (generator "eeschema") (generator_version "10.0")`,
  matching what eeschema writes for a new file. This covers only the
  fallback path; the main templates (which still carry the KiCad 9 version and
  the `_TEMPLATE_*` clone-source instances used by `add_schematic_component`)
  are tracked separately because rewriting them touches the component-cloning
  system.

- **`create_project` returns paths with a single separator** (#224): the
  returned `path`/`boardPath`/`schematicPath` were built with `os.path.join`,
  which on Windows mixed separators when the caller passed a forward-slash path
  (e.g. `C:/.../EspDinIoT\EspDinIoT.kicad_pro`). The reported paths are now
  normalized to forward slashes; the on-disk writes still use OS-native paths.

- **`create_schematic` accepts a full `.kicad_sch` path in `path`** (#242):
  passing a complete file path (e.g. `path="/foo/bar/V4.kicad_sch"`) previously
  treated it as a directory and appended the name again, producing
  `/foo/bar/V4.kicad_sch/V4.kicad_sch` and failing with "No such file or
  directory". The path is now used as-is when it already ends in `.kicad_sch`,
  in both `SchematicManager.create_schematic` and the `_handle_create_schematic`
  save step; passing a directory still works as before.

- **Backend is now pinned per loaded project (SWIG vs IPC)** (#223): commands
  on a single loaded project previously ran on whichever backend happened to
  be reachable per call — `create_project`/`open_project`/`add_layer` on SWIG
  while `save_project` silently upgraded to IPC, saving the live GUI's (stale)
  board and losing the SWIG-side edits. Now `open_project` pins the session to
  IPC only when the GUI provably has the same `.kicad_pcb` open; otherwise the
  whole lifecycle (including `save_project`) stays on SWIG, with a
  `_backend_note` on responses explaining why IPC wasn't used. IPC-pinned
  sessions fall back to SWIG (reloading from disk) if the GUI connection
  drops. `get_backend_state` gains `sessionBackend`/`sessionBoardPath`, and
  its `backend` field reflects the session pin while a project is loaded.

- **`rotate_component` now treats `angle` as an absolute target rotation**,
  matching its schema description. Previously the IPC backend added the
  supplied angle to the current rotation, so two consecutive
  `rotate_component(angle=90)` calls would rotate the part to 180° instead
  of leaving it at 90°. Workflows that relied on the additive behavior will
  need to be updated.

- **Project-scope `sym-lib-table` is now visible to symbol-discovery tools**:
  `search_symbols`, `list_symbol_libraries`, `list_library_symbols`, and
  `get_symbol_info` previously only consulted the global `sym-lib-table`. A
  library registered with project scope (i.e. an entry in
  `<project>/sym-lib-table`) was therefore invisible — even right after
  `open_project` succeeded — making `add_schematic_component` the only tool
  that could see it. Two changes:
  1. `open_project` and `create_project` now rebuild the
     `SymbolLibraryManager` against the project directory so subsequent
     search/list/info calls see project-scope libraries automatically.
  2. The four discovery tools also accept an optional `projectPath`
     parameter (a project directory, `.kicad_pro`, `.kicad_pcb`, or
     `.kicad_sch` path) for stateless callers, so project libraries can be
     resolved without first calling `open_project`.

- **IPC backend runtime reconnect**: MCP no longer stays on SWIG for the
  entire process when it starts before KiCAD. IPC-capable board tools now retry
  the IPC connection when KiCAD is running, refresh the live board API when a
  board becomes available, and report `_backend: "ipc"` when they actually use
  the IPC path. `check_kicad_ui`, `launch_kicad_ui`, and `get_backend_info`
  now include live backend status instead of only reflecting startup state.

- **Windows KiCAD Python discovery**: Windows startup now scans per-user KiCAD
  installs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KiCad` in addition to machine-wide
  installs under `C:\Program Files\KiCad` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\KiCad`,
  so user-scope installs no longer require a manual `KICAD_PYTHON` override.

- **IPC board size on KiCAD 10**: `get_board_info` now handles KiCAD 10 IPC
  `Box2` objects that expose `pos` / `size` instead of `min` / `max`, avoiding
  a zero-size board result with an attribute error.

- **Schematic symbol lookup**: `get_schematic_component`,
  `edit_schematic_component`, `set_schematic_component_property`,
  `remove_schematic_component_property`, and `delete_schematic_component`
  no longer fail with `Component '<ref>' not found in schematic` when the
  placed symbol uses KiCad's rescued / locally-customised serialisation
  form `(symbol (lib_name "...") (lib_id "...") ...)`. The block-matching
  regex now accepts any opening paren after `(symbol`, and the
  parent-position lookup uses the first `(at ...)` inside the symbol
  block, so newly-added properties anchor to the symbol origin instead of
  silently falling back to `(0, 0)`. Added 7 regression tests reproducing
  the failure on a real-world user schematic.

### New MCP Tools

- `suggest_placement` — Connectivity-driven footprint placement optimizer for
  the PCB: clusters components by netlist affinity, legalizes overlaps, and
  proposes (or with `apply: true`, applies) positions/rotations that shorten
  the ratsnest. Dry-run by default — it never mutates the board unless asked;
  deterministic, so the preview matches the applied result. Reports
  half-perimeter wirelength before/after.

- `suggest_schematic_declutter` — Re-orients overlapping net/global labels in
  a schematic for readability, holding every label anchor fixed so
  connectivity cannot change. Dry-run by default, like `suggest_placement`.

- `close_project` (#225) — Symmetric counterpart to `open_project` /
  `create_project`. Optionally saves the board (`save`, default `true`), then
  drops the in-memory board (SWIG + IPC) and clears all per-project session
  state (session-backend pin, disk signature, project paths). Lets an agent
  hand control back so the user — or the agent itself — can edit project files
  directly without a later MCP save clobbering those changes, which previously
  required manual open/close choreography. If `save=true` and the save fails,
  the close is refused so work is never silently lost; if `save=false` on a
  board with unsaved changes, the close proceeds with a warning.

- `add_gnd_stitching_vias` — Drop GND stitching vias across the board with
  collision checking against every non-GND segment, via, and pad on every
  copper layer. PTH vias penetrate the full stackup, so an F.Cu-only check
  (the most common shortcut) silently creates shorts on inner / B.Cu
  copper — this implementation explicitly walks all layers.

  Combines three placement strategies, freely composable:
  - `grid` — regular grid across the board interior.
  - `around_refs` — densify around named footprints (good for tucking
    extra ground under MCUs, switching regulators, or RF parts).
  - `in_zones` — restrict candidates to points inside the filled
    polygons of GND copper zones, so each new via actually stitches
    real ground polygons together rather than floating on silkscreen.

  Also supports per-via geometry control (`viaSize`, `viaDrill`,
  `clearance`, `edgeMargin`), an `maxVias` cap for incremental work,
  auto-detection of the GND net (tries `GND` / `GROUND` / `VSS` /
  `/GND`), and a `dryRun` mode that returns the placements that
  _would_ be made without modifying the board — useful for previewing
  before committing.

  Returns `{ placed: [{x, y, unit}, ...], summary: {placed_count, candidates_evaluated, skipped_by_zone_membership, skipped_by_collision, ...} }`.

  Approach ported from
  [morningfire-pcb-automation](https://github.com/NiNjA-CodE/morningfire-pcb-automation)
  (`scripts/ground/add_gnd_vias.py`). The original parses the PCB
  text with regex and writes new vias by string concatenation; this
  port reads obstacles via the pcbnew API so it handles rotated
  footprints correctly, integrates with the in-memory board (two
  sequential calls see each other's placements), picks up net codes
  from the live board, and adds the `in_zones` strategy + the
  `maxVias` cap + dry-run.

- `check_courtyard_overlaps` — Detect courtyard overlaps between footprints
  and (optionally) flag courtyards that extend past the board outline.
  Returns overlap pairs with intersection extents (mm), per-component
  boundary violations, and a placement summary. Accepts a `positions` dict
  of hypothetical placements (with optional rotation) so an AI agent can
  validate a proposed `move_component` / `place_component` before
  committing it — closing the feedback loop that previously required
  writing the move, running DRC, parsing violations, and reverting.

  Approach ported from
  [morningfire-pcb-automation](https://github.com/NiNjA-CodE/morningfire-pcb-automation)
  (`scripts/placement/check_overlaps.py`). The original uses a static
  per-footprint-type courtyard lookup table; this implementation reads
  the real courtyard polygons (or pad bounding box fallback) from the
  loaded board for accuracy on custom and rotated footprints, and adds
  virtual placement + clearance margin support.

- `query_zones` — Query copper zones (filled pours) on the board with optional
  filters by net, layer, or bounding box. Returns one entry per zone with its
  net, layers, priority, fill state, min thickness, bounding box, and filled
  area. Complements `query_traces`, which only reports tracks/vias and silently
  omits power-plane and GND pours — making layer-usage audits incomplete on any
  board that uses copper zones.

- `set_schematic_component_property` — Add or update a single custom property
  (BOM / sourcing field) on a placed schematic symbol. Convenience wrapper
  around `edit_schematic_component` for the common case of attaching one MPN /
  Manufacturer / DigiKey_PN / LCSC / JLCPCB_PN / Voltage / Tolerance /
  Dielectric value at a time. Newly created properties default to hidden so
  they do not clutter the schematic canvas.

- `remove_schematic_component_property` — Delete a custom property from a
  placed schematic symbol. The four built-in fields (Reference, Value,
  Footprint, Datasheet) are protected and cannot be removed; clear them by
  setting their value to `""` via `edit_schematic_component` instead.

### Tool Enhancements

- `autoroute`: best-of-N support. New optional parameters `attempts`,
  `targetNets`, and `passSchedule`. When `attempts > 1`, Freerouting is
  invoked multiple times with varied `--max-passes` values, each result
  is scored by `(nets_routed * 1000) + segments` plus a 50,000-point
  bonus when every `targetNets` entry is routed, and the winning SES is
  imported into the board. Single-attempt behaviour is unchanged when
  `attempts` is omitted, so existing callers don't need updates.

  Motivation: on dense boards a single Freerouting run routinely leaves
  1–7 nets unrouted. Cycling through a few `-mp` values typically drives
  the unrouted count to zero. Empirically, 3 attempts is usually enough
  for 4-layer designs; 5–8 for stubborn cases.

  The scoring approach and the default `passSchedule` are ported from
  [morningfire-pcb-automation](https://github.com/NiNjA-CodE/morningfire-pcb-automation)
  (`scripts/routing/freeroute_runner.py`). The MCP version adds:
  cleaner per-attempt result reporting, automatic single-thread
  optimisation (`-mt 1`) during scored attempts so the multi-threaded
  optimiser's known clearance-violation bug doesn't distort the
  comparison, and graceful degradation when one attempt errors out
  (the run continues and the best of the remainder wins).

- `edit_schematic_component`: extended with two new optional parameters that
  promote arbitrary custom properties to first-class citizens:
  - **`properties`** — map of property name to either a string value or a full
    spec object `{ value, x?, y?, angle?, hide?, fontSize? }`. Adds the
    property if it does not yet exist on the symbol, otherwise updates the
    existing value (and optionally its label position / visibility). Lets a
    single tool call attach an entire BOM / sourcing payload to a component:
    `properties: { MPN: "RC0603FR-0710KL", Manufacturer: "Yageo", Tolerance: "1%" }`.
  - **`removeProperties`** — list of custom property names to delete in the
    same call.
  - String values written through any of the property paths are now properly
    backslash-escaped so descriptions containing `"` or `\` no longer
    corrupt the .kicad_sch file.

- `get_schematic_component`: clarified description — it already returns every
  field on the symbol (built-in + custom). The tool description now spells
  this out explicitly so agents know they can use it to inspect MPN,
  Manufacturer, Distributor PN and other BOM fields without a separate call.

- `query_traces`: added to the IPC-capable board command path so trace reads
  can use live KiCAD board data when IPC is connected.

### New MCP Prompt

- `component_sourcing_properties` — Guides the LLM through attaching BOM and
  sourcing metadata (MPN, Manufacturer, distributor part numbers, parametric
  fields like Voltage / Tolerance / Dielectric) to schematic components. Lists
  the conventional property names recognised by downstream BOM tooling and the
  recommended call sequence (`list_schematic_components` →
  `get_schematic_component` → `set_schematic_component_property` /
  `edit_schematic_component`).

### Tests

- `tests/test_schematic_component_properties.py`: 32 new tests covering custom
  property add / update / remove (single + batched), full spec dicts, position
  defaults, `(hide yes)` defaulting, protected built-in field rejection,
  no-op removal, special-character escaping, UUID preservation, and the two
  new convenience tools.

- `tests/test_backend_metadata.py`: regression coverage for backend metadata,
  runtime IPC reconnect after KiCAD starts, IPC-backed `query_traces`, and
  KiCAD 10 IPC `Box2` board-size compatibility.

### Removed

- `add_schematic_junction` MCP tool has been removed. Junctions are now
  inserted and removed automatically via `WireManager.sync_junctions` whenever
  wires are added, deleted, or moved.
- Junction placement is pin-aware: `sync_junctions` consults component pin
  positions so that T-junctions at component pins are correctly recognised.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Merged: PR #57 (Kletternaut/demo/rpiCSI-videotest → main)

This release incorporates 28 commits developed and live-tested during a full
Raspberry Pi CSI adapter PCB design session. All tools listed below were validated
end-to-end using Claude Desktop + KiCAD 9 on Windows.

### New MCP Tools

- `connect_passthrough` — Schematic-only tool that wires all pins of one connector
  directly to the matching pins of another (e.g. J1 pin N → J2 pin N). Creates nets
  named with a configurable prefix (`netPrefix`). Designed for FFC/ribbon cable
  passthrough adapters. **Schematic only — do not call for PCB routing.**

- `sync_schematic_to_board` — Imports all net/pad assignments from the schematic
  into the open PCB file. Required after `connect_passthrough` before routing can
  start. Returns `pads_assigned` count for verification.

- `snapshot_project` — Saves a named checkpoint of the entire project folder into a
  `snapshots/` subdirectory inside the project. Allows resuming from a known-good
  state without redoing earlier steps. Accepts `step`, `label`, and optional `prompt`
  parameters.

- `run_erc` — Runs KiCAD's Electrical Rules Check on the schematic and returns
  violations as structured JSON.

- `import_svg_logo` — Converts an SVG file to PCB silkscreen polygons and places
  them on a specified layer.

### Bug Fixes

- `route_pad_to_pad`: **Critical fix for B.Cu footprints in KiCAD 9.** `pad.GetLayerName()`
  always returned `F.Cu` for SMD pads on flipped footprints (KiCAD 9 SWIG bug).
  Fix: use `footprint.GetLayer()` instead, which correctly reflects the placed layer
  after `Flip()`. Without this fix, no vias were inserted for back-to-back connectors.

- `route_pad_to_pad`: Via was placed at the geometric midpoint between the two pads.
  For back-to-back mirrored connectors (J1 F.Cu / J2 B.Cu) this caused all 15 vias
  to stack at the same X coordinate (board center). Fix: via is now placed at the
  X coordinate of the start pad (`via_x = start_pos.x`), producing 15 parallel
  vertical traces.

- `place_component` (B.Cu footprints): `Flip()` was called before `board.Add()`,
  causing KiCAD 9 to hang for ~30 seconds. Fix: `board.Add()` first, then `Flip()`.

- `add_board_outline`: Three separate bugs fixed — incorrect cornerRadius fallback,
  wrong top-left origin default, and broken arc delegation for IPC rounded rectangles.

- `snapshot_project`: Snapshots were saved one level above the project directory,
  cluttering the parent folder. Fix: snapshots now go into `<project>/snapshots/`.

- MCP server log timestamp was always UTC/ISO. Fix: now uses local system time.

- `search_tools` (router pattern): direct tools like `snapshot_project` were invisible
  to the router. Fix: direct tool names added to the router's known-tool list.

**What it does:**

- `export_gerber` automatically copies the current MCP session log into the project's
  `logs/` subdirectory as `mcp_log_<timestamp>.txt`.
- `snapshot_project` copies the MCP session log into `logs/` at every checkpoint as
  `mcp_log_step<N>_<timestamp>.txt`.
- If a `prompt` parameter is passed to `snapshot_project`, it is saved as
  `PROMPT_step<N>_<timestamp>.md` alongside the log.

**Purpose:** Makes it easy to include the full tool call history when filing a bug
report or GitHub issue — just attach the log file from the project's `logs/` folder.

> ⚠️ **Privacy warning:** The MCP session log contains the **complete conversation
> history** between Claude and the MCP server, including all tool parameters and
> responses. When sharing a project directory (e.g. as a ZIP attachment in a GitHub
> issue), **review or delete the `logs/` folder first** to avoid accidentally
> disclosing sensitive file paths, component names, or design details.

### Snapshot Logging (always active)

Regardless of dev mode, `snapshot_project` now always saves a copy of the current
MCP session log into `<project>/logs/` at each checkpoint. This means every project
automatically retains a traceable record of which tools were called and in what order.

> ⚠️ **Same privacy note applies:** the `logs/` directory inside your project folder
> contains tool call history. Do not share it publicly without reviewing its contents.

## [2.2.2-alpha] - 2026-03-01

### New MCP Tools

- `route_pad_to_pad` – Convenience wrapper around `route_trace` that looks up pad positions
  automatically. Accepts `fromRef`/`fromPad`/`toRef`/`toPad` instead of raw XY coordinates.
  Auto-detects net from pad assignment (overridable via `net` param). Saves ~2 tool calls per
  connection (~64 calls for a full TMC2209 board compared to the 3-step get_pad_position flow).
  Live tested: ESP32 ↔ TMC2209 STEP/DIR traces routed without prior coordinate lookup. ✅

- `copy_routing_pattern` – Now registered as MCP tool in TypeScript layer (`routing.ts`).
  Was previously implemented in Python but missing from the MCP tool registry.
  Parameters: `sourceRefs`, `targetRefs`, `includeVias?`, `traceWidth?`.

### Bug Fixes

- `add_schematic_component` / `DynamicSymbolLoader`: ignored project-local `sym-lib-table`.
  `find_library_file()` only searched global KiCAD install directories, causing "library not
  found" errors for any symbol in a project-local `.kicad_sym` file. Fix: added `project_path`
  parameter; reads project `sym-lib-table` first via new `_resolve_library_from_table()` helper
  before falling back to global dirs. `project_path` is auto-derived from the schematic path.

- `place_component`: ignored project-local `fp-lib-table`. `FootprintLibraryManager` was
  initialised once at server start without a project path, so self-created `.kicad_mod`
  footprints were never found. Fix: new `boardPath` parameter in TypeScript + Python;
  `_handle_place_component` wrapper recreates `FootprintLibraryManager(project_path=…)` whenever
  the active project changes (cached to avoid redundant recreation).

- `copy_routing_pattern`: copied 0 traces when pads had no net assignments. The filter
  `track.GetNetname() in source_nets` always returned empty when pads were placed without net
  assignment. Fix: geometric fallback using bounding box of source footprint pads ±5mm
  tolerance. Response includes `filterMethod` field indicating which mode was used
  (`"net-based"` or `"geometric (pads have no nets)"`).

- `template_with_symbols.kicad_sch`, `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: restored
  format version `20250114` (KiCAD 9) after upstream commit `2b38796` accidentally downgraded
  both files to `20240101`. KiCAD 9 rejects schematics with outdated version numbers.

- **CRITICAL: `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`**: removed 7 invalid `;;` comment
  lines introduced by upstream commit `b98c94b`. KiCAD's S-expression parser does not support
  any comment syntax — it expects every non-empty, non-whitespace line to start with `(`.
  The comments (`;; PASSIVES`, `;; SEMICONDUCTORS`, `;; INTEGRATED CIRCUITS`, `;; CONNECTORS`,
  `;; POWER/REGULATORS`, `;; MISC`, `;; TEMPLATE INSTANCES (...)`) caused KiCAD 9 to reject
  every schematic created from this template with a hard parse error:

  > `Expecting '(' in <file>.kicad_sch, line 8, offset 5`
  > **Action required for existing projects:** delete every line beginning with `;;` from any
  > `.kicad_sch` file created between upstream commit `b98c94b` and this fix.

- `add_schematic_component` / `inject_symbol_into_schematic`: symbol definition in
  `lib_symbols` was never refreshed after editing via `create_symbol` / `edit_symbol`.
  If the symbol was already present in the schematic's embedded `lib_symbols` section,
  the function returned immediately — `delete + re-add` still pulled in the stale cached
  definition. Fix: always read the current definition from the `.kicad_sym` file; if a
  stale entry exists in `lib_symbols`, remove it first, then inject the fresh one.
  Verified live. ✅

- `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: removed 13 legacy `_TEMPLATE_*` offscreen
  instances (`_TEMPLATE_R`, `_TEMPLATE_C`, `_TEMPLATE_U`, etc.) that were placed at
  `x=-100` as clone-sources for the old `ComponentManager` approach. `DynamicSymbolLoader`
  (the current implementation) injects symbols directly and never needs these placeholders.
  They appeared as dangling reference designators in KiCAD's component navigator and in
  the schematic canvas when zoomed far out.

### Maintenance

- `.gitignore`: added `*.kicad_pcb.bak`, `*.kicad_pro.bak` alongside existing `-bak` variants;
  consolidated personal/local files under `myContribution/`.

---

## [2.2.1-alpha] - 2026-02-28

### New MCP Tools

- `edit_schematic_component` – Update properties of a placed symbol in-place (footprint,
  value, reference rename). More efficient than delete + re-add: preserves position and UUID.

### Bug Fixes

- `add_schematic_component`: `footprint` parameter was accepted but silently ignored – the
  value was never passed through to `DynamicSymbolLoader.add_component()` /
  `create_component_instance()`. All newly placed symbols always had an empty Footprint
  field. Fix: added `footprint: str = ""` to both functions and threaded it through every
  call site including the TypeScript tool schema.

- `delete_schematic_component`: only deleted the first matching instance when duplicate
  references existed (e.g. after an aborted add attempt). Root cause: loop used `break`
  after the first match. Fix: collect all matching blocks first, then delete them all back-
  to-front (to preserve line indices). Response now includes `deleted_count`.

- `templates/*.kicad_sch`, `project.py`, `schematic.py`: Update KiCAD schematic format
  version from `20230121` (KiCAD 7) to `20250114` (KiCAD 9). The MCP server targets
  KiCAD 9 exclusively (`pcbnew.pyd` compiled for KiCAD 9.0, Python 3.11.5) – generating
  files in an outdated format caused a spurious "This file was created with an older
  KiCAD version" warning on every newly created schematic.

- `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: Remove 13 corrupt `_TEMPLATE_*` placed-symbol
  blocks with `(lib_id -100)` – an integer caused by old sexpdata serializer (same bug
  PR #40 fixed for the add path). KiCAD crashed with a null-pointer when selecting these
  symbols. They appeared as grey `_TEMPLATE_R?`, `_TEMPLATE_U_REG?` etc. labels far
  outside the sheet boundary (~5000mm off-sheet).

  **Discovered via:** live testing on a real JLCPCB/KiCAD 9 project.
  **Affected users:** schematics created from this template before this fix contain the
  same corrupt blocks – remove all `(symbol (lib_id -100) ...)` blocks whose Reference
  starts with `_TEMPLATE_`.

## [2.2.0-alpha] - 2026-02-27

### New MCP Tools (TypeScript layer – previously Python-only)

**Routing tools:**

- `delete_trace` - Delete traces by UUID, position or net name
- `query_traces` - Query/filter traces on the board
- `get_nets_list` - List all nets with net code and class
- `modify_trace` - Modify trace width or layer
- `create_netclass` - Create or update a net class
- `route_differential_pair` - Route a differential pair between two points
- `refill_zones` - Refill all copper zones ⚠️ SWIG segfault risk, prefer IPC/UI

**Component tools:**

- `get_component_pads` - Get all pad data for a component
- `get_component_list` - List all components on the board
- `get_pad_position` - Get absolute position of a specific pad
- `place_component_array` - Place components in a grid array
- `align_components` - Align components along an axis
- `duplicate_component` - Duplicate a component with offset

### Bug Fixes

- `routing.py`: Fix SwigPyObject UUID comparison (`str()` → `m_Uuid.AsString()`)
- `routing.py`: Fix SWIG iterator invalidation after `board.Remove()` by snapshotting `list(board.Tracks())`
- `routing.py`: Add `board.SetModified()` + `track = None` after `Remove()` to prevent dangling SWIG pointer crashes
- `routing.py`: Per-track `try/except` in `query_traces()` to skip invalid objects after bulk delete
- `routing.py`: Add missing return statement (mypy)
- `library.py`: Fix `search_footprints` parameter mapping (`search_term` → `pattern`)
- `library.py`: Fix field access (`fp.name` → `fp.full_name`)
- `library.py`: Accept both `pattern` and `search_term` parameter names
- `library.py`: Fix loop variable shadowing `Path` object (mypy)
- `design_rules.py`: Add type annotation for `violation_counts` (mypy)

### New MCP Tools (cont.)

**Datasheet tools:**

- `get_datasheet_url` - Return LCSC datasheet PDF URL and product page URL for a given
  LCSC number (e.g. `C179739` → `https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/C179739.pdf`).
  No API key required – URL is constructed directly from the LCSC number.
- `enrich_datasheets` - Scan a `.kicad_sch` file and write LCSC datasheet URLs into
  every symbol that has an `LCSC` property but an empty `Datasheet` field. After
  enrichment the URL appears natively in KiCAD's symbol properties, footprint browser
  and any other tool that reads the standard KiCAD `Datasheet` field.
  Supports `dry_run=true` for preview without writing.
  Implementation: `python/commands/datasheet_manager.py` (text-based, no `skip` writes)

**Schematic tools:**

- `delete_schematic_component` - Remove a placed symbol from a `.kicad_sch` file by
  reference designator (e.g. `R1`, `U3`).

### Bug Fixes (cont.)

- `schematic.ts` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix missing `delete_schematic_component` MCP tool.

  **Root cause (two separate issues):**
  1. No MCP tool named `delete_schematic_component` existed. Claude had no way to call
     it, so any "delete schematic component" request fell through to the PCB-only
     `delete_component` tool, which searches `pcbnew.BOARD` and always returned
     "Component not found" for schematic symbols.
  2. `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` still used `skip` for writes.
     PR #40 rewrote `DynamicSymbolLoader` (add path) to avoid `skip`-induced schematic
     corruption, but `remove_component` (delete path) was not touched by that PR.

  **Fix:**
  - Added `delete_schematic_component` to the TypeScript tool layer (`schematic.ts`)
    with clear docstring distinguishing it from the PCB `delete_component`.
  - Implemented `_handle_delete_schematic_component` in `kicad_interface.py` using
    direct text manipulation (parenthesis-depth tracking, same approach as PR #40).
    Does not call `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` at all.
  - Error message explicitly guides the user when the wrong tool is used:
    _"note: this tool removes schematic symbols, use delete_component for PCB footprints"_

### Additional Bug Fixes

- `connection_schematic.py` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` missing
  `schematic_path` parameter – without it `get_net_connections` always fell back to
  proximity matching which only returns one connection per component (first wire hit,
  then `break`). PinLocator was never invoked. Fix: added `schematic_path: Optional[Path]`
  to `generate_netlist` signature and threaded it through to `get_net_connections`,
  and updated `_handle_generate_netlist` in `kicad_interface.py` to pass `schematic_path`.
- `server.ts`: Fix KiCAD bundled Python (3.11.5) not being selected on Windows – the
  detection condition `process.env.PYTHONPATH?.includes("KiCad")` was fragile and failed
  in some environments, causing System Python 3.12 to be used instead. Since `pcbnew.pyd`
  is compiled for KiCAD's Python 3.11.5, this resulted in `No module named 'pcbnew'`.
  Fix: removed the condition, KiCAD bundled Python is now always preferred on Windows
  when it exists at `C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe`.
  Also added `KICAD_PYTHON` to `claude_desktop_config.json` as explicit override.
- `pin_locator.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` timeout – `get_pin_location` and
  `get_all_symbol_pins` called `Schematic(schematic_path)` on every single pin lookup,
  causing O(nets × components × pins) schematic file loads (e.g. 400+ loads for a
  medium schematic). Fix: added `_schematic_cache` dict to `PinLocator.__init__`,
  schematic is now loaded once per path and reused.
