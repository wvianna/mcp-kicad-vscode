# KiCAD IPC Backend Implementation Status

**Status:** Under Active Development and Testing
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**KiCAD Version:** 9.0+
**kicad-python Version:** 0.5.0+

---

## Overview

The IPC backend provides real-time UI synchronization with KiCAD 9.0+ via the official IPC API. When KiCAD is running with IPC enabled, commands can update the KiCAD UI immediately without requiring manual reload.

This feature is experimental and under active testing. The server uses a hybrid
approach: IPC when available, automatic fallback to SWIG when IPC is not
connected, and runtime reconnect when KiCAD becomes available after the MCP
server has already started. Tools with IPC implementations recheck IPC
availability at runtime and reconnect if KiCAD is available, which prevents the
MCP from staying in SWIG for the entire session after an initial failure to
connect to IPC.

## Key Differences

| Feature        | SWIG                   | IPC                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| UI Updates     | Manual reload required | Immediate (when working) |
| Undo/Redo      | Not supported          | Transaction support      |
| API Stability  | Deprecated in KiCAD 9  | Official, versioned      |
| Connection     | File-based             | Live socket connection   |
| KiCAD Required | No (file operations)   | Yes (must be running)    |

## Implemented IPC Commands

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **KiCAD 9.0+** must be running
2. **IPC API must be enabled**: `Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server`
3. A board must be open in the PCB editor

### Installation

```bash
pip install kicad-python
```

### Runtime Backend Selection

At startup, the server attempts IPC first when `KICAD_BACKEND` is `auto` or
`ipc`. If KiCAD is not running yet, `auto` mode falls back to SWIG so file-based
operations can still work.

IPC-capable board tools now retry the IPC connection at runtime. This means the
following workflow can switch from SWIG to IPC without restarting the MCP
server:

1. Start the MCP server before KiCAD is running.
2. Launch KiCAD manually or with `launch_kicad_ui`.
3. Open a board with IPC enabled in KiCAD.
4. Call a normal IPC-capable board tool such as `get_board_info`,
   `get_layer_list`, `get_component_list`, `get_nets_list`, or `query_traces`.

When the reconnect succeeds, tool responses include `_backend: "ipc"` and
`_realtime: true`. If IPC is still unavailable or no board API can be opened,
the server continues to use SWIG and reports `_backend: "swig"` for the result.

Use `check_kicad_ui`, `launch_kicad_ui`, or `get_backend_info` to inspect the
current live backend status. These responses include `backend`,
`realtime_sync`, and `ipc_connected`.

### Session Pinning (issue #223)

Once a project is loaded, its entire lifecycle is **pinned to one backend**
until it is reopened:

- `open_project` pins the session to **ipc** only when the live KiCad GUI
  provably has the _same_ `.kicad_pcb` open (path comparison via the IPC
  open-documents list). Otherwise — including every `create_project`, since
  the GUI cannot have a brand-new board open — the session pins to **swig**.
- A **swig-pinned session never silently upgrades to IPC**, even if KiCad
  starts later and IPC connects. The GUI's in-memory board would be stale
  relative to the MCP's edits, and routing `save_project` through IPC would
  clobber them — the exact lost-edits bug in #223. Affected responses carry a
  `_backend_note` explaining the pin; to adopt the live GUI, open the board in
  KiCad and call `open_project` again.
- An **ipc-pinned session falls back to swig** if the IPC connection drops
  (e.g. the GUI is closed); the board is reloaded from its last on-disk state.
- `get_backend_state` reports the pin as `sessionBackend` /
  `sessionBoardPath`, and its `backend` field reflects the session pin (not
  just connectivity) whenever a project is loaded.

The runtime-reconnect workflow above still applies when **no project is
loaded** — connectivity upgrades are only restricted once a board is open.

### Testing

Run the test script to verify IPC functionality:

```bash
# Make sure KiCAD is running with IPC enabled and a board open
./venv/bin/python python/test_ipc_backend.py
```

## Known Limitations

1. **KiCAD must be running**: Unlike SWIG, IPC requires KiCAD to be open
2. **Project creation**: Not supported via IPC, uses file system
3. **Footprint library access**: Uses hybrid approach (SWIG loads from library, IPC places)
4. **Delete trace**: Falls back to SWIG (IPC API doesn't support direct deletion)
5. **Reconnect still requires IPC prerequisites**: Runtime reconnect only
   succeeds when KiCAD is running with IPC enabled and a board is available
6. **SWIG-pinned sessions stay SWIG**: after `create_project`/`open_project`
   runs on SWIG, the session does not switch to IPC mid-project (see Session
   Pinning above) — reopen the project while it is open in the GUI to use IPC
7. **Some operations may not work as expected**: This is experimental code

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed"

- Ensure KiCAD is running
- Enable IPC API: `Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server`
- Check if a board is open
- If MCP started before KiCAD, call `check_kicad_ui` or retry an IPC-capable
  board tool after KiCAD and the board are ready

### "kicad-python not found"

```bash
pip install kicad-python
```

### "Version mismatch"

- Update kicad-python: `pip install --upgrade kicad-python`
- Ensure KiCAD 9.0+ is installed

### "No board open"

- Open a board in KiCAD's PCB editor before connecting

## Future Work

1. More comprehensive testing of all IPC commands
2. Footprint library integration via IPC (when kipy supports it)
3. Schematic IPC support (when available in kicad-python)
4. Event subscriptions to react to changes made in KiCAD UI
5. Multi-board support
