# JLCPCB Integration Guide

> **Note:** This document provides usage examples and workflow guidance. For complete API reference and setup instructions, see [JLCPCB_INTEGRATION.md](JLCPCB_INTEGRATION.md).

The KiCAD MCP Server works with JLCPCB parts through two backends, by design:

- **Search → local snapshot.** `search_jlcpcb_parts` queries a local SQLite database
  you populate once with `download_jlcpcb_database` (default `cdfer` source, a ~600k
  in-stock subset). The JLCPCB Open Platform API has **no search endpoint**, so search
  must run locally.
- **Single-part lookup → real-time.** `get_jlcpcb_part` prefers the JLCPCB **Open
  Platform** `getComponentDetailByCode` endpoint for live stock and tiered pricing when
  credentials are set, and falls back to the local snapshot otherwise. Each result's
  `source` field says which backend answered (`"live-api"` vs `"local-db"`).

You can also search JLCPCB **local symbol libraries** installed via KiCad PCM
_(contributed by [@l3wi](https://github.com/l3wi) in [PR #25](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server/pull/25))_.

## Credits

- **Local Symbol Library Search**: Implementation by [@l3wi](https://github.com/l3wi) - [PR #25](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server/pull/25)
- **JLCPCB API Integration**: Built on top of the local library foundation

---

## Approach 1: Local snapshot database (Recommended for search)

### What It Does

- A local SQLite snapshot of ~600k in-stock JLCPCB parts for fast offline **search**
- **No authentication required** — the default `cdfer` source is a public prebuilt DB
- Pricing, stock and Basic/Extended library type per part (as of the snapshot date)
- Powers `search_jlcpcb_parts`, `suggest_jlcpcb_alternatives` and the local fallback
  for `get_jlcpcb_part`

> The snapshot mirror can lag JLCPCB by days-to-weeks, so a specific part's stock/price
> may be stale. Use `get_jlcpcb_part` with Open Platform credentials (Approach 3) for
> real-time figures on a part you care about.

### Setup

No credentials required — just download the database:

```
download_jlcpcb_database({ force: false })
```

This fetches the prebuilt `cdfer` catalog and builds a local SQLite database. See
`get_jlcpcb_database_stats` for the resulting counts and path.

**Expected Output:**

```
✓ Successfully downloaded JLCPCB parts database
Source: cdfer
Total parts: ~600,000
Database size: ~465 MB
```

### Usage Examples

See "Approach 2" usage examples below - the API is the same.

---

## Approach 2: Local Symbol Libraries (Good for Offline Use)

### What It Does

- Searches symbol libraries you've installed via KiCad's Plugin and Content Manager (PCM)
- Works with community JLCPCB libraries like `JLCPCB-KiCad-Library`
- No API credentials needed
- Works offline
- Symbols already have LCSC IDs and footprints configured

### Setup

1. **Install JLCPCB Libraries via KiCad PCM:**
   - Open KiCad → Tools → Plugin and Content Manager
   - Search for "JLCPCB" or "JLC"
   - Install libraries like:
     - `JLCPCB-KiCad-Library` (community maintained)
     - `EDA_MCP` (contains common JLCPCB parts)
     - Any other JLCPCB-compatible libraries

2. **Verify Installation:**
   The libraries should appear in KiCad's symbol library table.

### Usage Examples

#### Search for Components

```
search_symbols({
  query: "ESP32",
  library: "JLCPCB"  // Filter to JLCPCB libraries only
})
```

Returns:

```
Found 12 symbols matching "ESP32":

PCM_JLCPCB-MCUs:ESP32-C3 | LCSC: C2934196 | ESP32-C3 RISC-V WiFi/BLE SoC
PCM_JLCPCB-MCUs:ESP32-S2 | LCSC: C701342 | ESP32-S2 WiFi SoC
...
```

#### Search by LCSC ID

```
search_symbols({
  query: "C2934196"  // Direct LCSC ID search
})
```

#### Get Symbol Details

```
get_symbol_info({
  symbol: "PCM_JLCPCB-MCUs:ESP32-C3"
})
```

Returns:

```
Symbol: PCM_JLCPCB-MCUs:ESP32-C3
Description: ESP32-C3 RISC-V WiFi/BLE SoC
LCSC: C2934196
Manufacturer: Espressif
MPN: ESP32-C3-WROOM-02
Footprint: Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-32-1EP_5x5mm_P0.5mm
Class: Extended
```

### Advantages

- ✅ No API credentials required
- ✅ Works offline after library installation
- ✅ Symbols pre-configured with correct footprints
- ✅ Community-maintained and curated
- ✅ Instant availability

### Limitations

- ❌ Only parts in installed libraries (typically 1k-10k parts)
- ❌ No real-time pricing or stock information
- ❌ Requires manual library updates via PCM

---

## Approach 3: JLCPCB Open Platform API (real-time lookup)

### What It Does

- Real-time **single-part** detail via the JLCPCB **Open Platform**
  (`https://open.jlcpcb.com`, `getComponentDetailByCode`)
- Provides **live pricing and stock information** (not the snapshot)
- Automatic **Basic vs Extended** library type identification (Basic = free assembly)
- Used by `get_jlcpcb_part`, which falls back to the local snapshot if the API call
  fails or credentials are absent; the result's `source` field reports which backend
  answered

> The Open Platform has **no search endpoint** — it only returns detail by LCSC code.
> Keyword/parametric search always runs against the local snapshot (Approach 1).

### Setup

#### 1. Get JLCPCB API Credentials

Log in to your JLCPCB account, open **Account → API Management**, create an API key,
and save your App ID, Access Key and Secret Key.

#### 2. Configure credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root (it is gitignored — copy `.env.example`):

```
JLCPCB_APP_ID=your_app_id
JLCPCB_API_KEY=your_access_key
JLCPCB_API_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

The server auto-loads this `.env` on first use of the JLCPCB client, non-destructively
(it never overrides a variable already set in the environment). You may also export the
same variables in your shell instead.

#### 3. Look up a part

No separate download step is needed for real-time lookup:

```
get_jlcpcb_part({ lcsc_number: "C25804" })
```

**Output (abridged):**

```
LCSC: C25804
MFR Part: ...
Stock: 12345
Source: JLCPCB Open Platform (real-time)

Price Breaks:
  1+: $0.02/ea
  100+: $0.01/ea
```

### Usage Examples

## Best Practices: Using Both Approaches Together

### Workflow 1: Design with Known Components

**Use Local Libraries:**

```
1. search_symbols({ query: "STM32F103", library: "JLCPCB" })
2. Select component from installed library
3. Component already has correct symbol + footprint + LCSC ID
```

**Why:** Faster, symbols are pre-configured and tested.

### Workflow 2: Find Optimal Part for Cost

**Use JLCPCB API:**

```
1. search_jlcpcb_parts({
     query: "10k resistor",
     package: "0603",
     library_type: "Basic"
   })
2. Select cheapest Basic part
3. Use suggested footprint from API
```

**Why:** Ensures lowest cost and maximum stock availability.

### Workflow 3: Explore Unknown Parts

**Start with API, verify with Libraries:**

```
1. search_jlcpcb_parts({ query: "ESP32", limit: 20 })
2. Find interesting part (e.g., C2934196)
3. search_symbols({ query: "C2934196" })
4. If found in library → use library symbol
5. If not found → use API footprint suggestion
```

**Why:** Combines discovery power of API with quality of curated libraries.

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Prefer Basic Parts

```
search_jlcpcb_parts({
  query: "resistor 10k",
  library_type: "Basic"  // Free assembly!
})
```

**Why:** Basic parts have **$0 assembly fee**. Extended parts charge **$3 per unique part**.

### 2. Use Alternatives Tool

```
suggest_jlcpcb_alternatives({ lcsc_number: "C12345" })
```

**Why:** Find cheaper, more available, or Basic alternatives automatically.

### 3. Check Stock Levels

Always filter `in_stock: true` to avoid ordering parts that are out of stock:

```
search_jlcpcb_parts({
  query: "capacitor",
  in_stock: true  // Only show available parts
})
```

### 4. Calculate BOM Cost

For each part in your design:

1. Use `get_jlcpcb_part()` to get price breaks
2. Sum up total cost based on order quantity
3. Check library_type count (each unique Extended part = $3 fee)

---

## Updating the Database

The JLCPCB parts database should be updated periodically to get latest parts and pricing.

### Manual Update

```
download_jlcpcb_database({ force: true })
```

This re-downloads the entire catalog and replaces the existing database.

### Automatic Updates (Future)

Future versions will support incremental updates that only fetch new/changed parts.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "JLCPCB API credentials not configured"

**Solution:** Set environment variables:

```bash
export JLCPCB_API_KEY="your_key"
export JLCPCB_API_SECRET="your_secret"
```

### "Database not found or empty"

**Solution:** Run:

```
download_jlcpcb_database({ force: false })
```

### "No symbols found" (Local Libraries)

**Solution:**

1. Install JLCPCB libraries via KiCad PCM
2. Verify library is enabled in KiCad symbol library table
3. Restart KiCad MCP server

### "Authentication failed"

**Solution:**

1. Verify your API credentials are correct
2. Check JLCPCB account has API access enabled
3. Try regenerating API key/secret in JLCPCB dashboard

## Summary

**Use Local Libraries when:**

- Starting a new design with common components
- You want pre-configured, tested symbols
- Working offline
- Components are in installed libraries

**Use JLCPCB API when:**

- Optimizing cost (find cheapest Basic parts)
- Checking real-time stock availability
- Exploring parts outside installed libraries
- Need complete catalog access

**Best approach:** Use both! Start with local libraries for known components, then use API for cost optimization and finding alternatives.
