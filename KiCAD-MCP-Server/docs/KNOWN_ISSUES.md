# Known Issues & Workarounds

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-01
**Version:** 2.7.0

This document tracks known issues and provides workarounds where available.

## Current Issues

### 1. `get_board_info` KiCAD 9.0 API Issue

**Status:** KNOWN - Non-critical

**Symptoms:**

```
AttributeError: 'BOARD' object has no attribute 'LT_USER'
```

**Root Cause:** KiCAD 9.0 changed layer enumeration constants

**Workaround:** Use `get_project_info` instead for basic project details

**Impact:** Low - informational command only

---

### 2. Zone Filling via SWIG Causes Segfault

**Status:** KNOWN - Workaround available

**Symptoms:**

- Copper pours created but not filled automatically when using SWIG backend
- Calling `ZONE_FILLER` via SWIG causes segfault

**Workaround Options:**

1. Use IPC backend (zones fill correctly via IPC)
2. Open the board in KiCAD UI -- zones fill automatically when opened
3. Use `refill_zones` tool (may still segfault in some configurations)

**Impact:** Medium - affects copper pour visualization until opened in KiCAD

---

### 3. UI Manual Reload Required (SWIG Backend)

**Status:** BY DESIGN

**Symptoms:**

- MCP makes changes via SWIG backend
- KiCAD does not show changes until file is reloaded

**Why:** SWIG-based backend modifies files directly and cannot push changes to a running UI

**Fix:** Use IPC backend for real-time updates (requires KiCAD running with IPC enabled)

**Workaround:** Click the reload prompt in KiCAD or use File > Revert

---

### 4. IPC Backend Limitations

**Status:** EXPERIMENTAL

**Known Limitations:**

- KiCAD must be running with IPC enabled (Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server)
- Some commands fall back to SWIG (e.g., delete_trace)
- Footprint loading uses hybrid approach (SWIG for library, IPC for placement)

**Workaround:** The server automatically falls back to SWIG backend when IPC is unavailable

---

### 5. `.kicad_pro` net_settings Must Be Edited via JSON Merge

**Status:** BY DESIGN (guard added)

Backend board saves are wrapped in `preserve_project_settings()`
(`python/utils/project_settings_guard.py`): pcbnew serializes a possibly
stale in-memory project model over `.kicad_pro` on every
`SaveBoard`/`BOARD.Save`, so the guard restores the on-disk
`net_settings` (and any dropped top-level keys) after each save.

**Implication:** commands must persist net class / netclass_patterns
changes via direct JSON read-modify-write of the `.kicad_pro` (the
`persist_netclass_to_project` pattern in `python/commands/routing.py`),
never through the pcbnew project model — model-side changes to
`net_settings` are intentionally reverted by the guard.

### 6. Flat Vendor Symbols Break kicad-skip-Based Tools (now diagnosed)

**Status:** MITIGATED — loud structured errors

SnapEDA/SamacSys `.kicad_sym` captures put pins/graphics directly under the
top-level `(symbol "NAME" ...)` with no `_1_1` sub-unit. KiCad and kicad-cli
tolerate this, but kicad-skip's parser crashes on it, taking down every
skip-based tool for the whole sheet (including sheets that merely embed a
snapshot of such a symbol in their own `lib_symbols`).

Schematic load failures now raise `SchematicLoadError` and all schematic
tools return a structured error naming the offending symbols:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "schematic_load_failed",
  "flatSymbols": ["LIB:PART"],
  "message": "Schematic load failed for ...: embedded flat lib symbols [...]"
}
```

**Workaround:** run the `repair_flat_symbols` tool (if available) or wrap
each flat symbol's pins/graphics in a `(symbol "NAME_1_1" ...)` sub-unit.
Note that tools which previously returned partial/empty results on
unparseable schematics (e.g. `find_orphaned_wires`, hierarchical net
traversal, `sync_schematic_to_board`) now return errors instead.

## Recently Fixed (v2.7.0)

### Python Bridge Delivered Responses to the Wrong Caller (Fixed v2.7.0, #373)

- After a tool call timed out, the late reply resolved the _next_ request, and
  every response after that was off by one. Requests now carry an ID that
  Python echoes back, and stale responses are discarded.

### Clients Stalled for up to Two Minutes at Startup (Fixed v2.7.0, #377)

- The MCP transport used to connect only after Python and pcbnew had finished
  initialising. It now connects first, so `initialize` and `tools/list` answer
  immediately and tool calls queue behind a ready gate.

### `add_symbol_property` Corrupted `.kicad_sym` Libraries (Fixed v2.7.0)

- Every call dropped a closing paren, and a new property could land inside the
  last unit or outside the symbol entirely. The write path now matches parens
  with string awareness, verifies the result before writing, and writes
  atomically.

### Concurrent Servers Fought Over One Log File (Fixed v2.7.0, #373)

- Log files are now per-process, named `kicad_interface-<pid>.log`. Old logs
  are swept after seven days.

## Recently Fixed (v2.2.0 - v2.2.3)

### B.Cu Footprint Routing (Fixed v2.2.3)

- `route_pad_to_pad` now correctly detects B.Cu footprints and inserts vias
- KiCAD 9 SWIG `pad.GetLayerName()` always returned F.Cu for flipped footprints -- fixed using `footprint.GetLayer()`

### B.Cu Placement Hang (Fixed v2.2.3)

- Placing footprints on B.Cu no longer causes ~30s freeze
- Fix: call `board.Add()` before `Flip()`

### Board Outline Rounded Corners (Fixed v2.2.3)

- `add_board_outline` now correctly applies cornerRadius for rounded_rectangle shape

### Project-Local Library Resolution (Fixed v2.2.2)

- `add_schematic_component` and `place_component` now search project-local sym-lib-table and fp-lib-table
- Previously only global KiCAD library paths were searched

### Template File Corruption (Fixed v2.2.2)

- Removed invalid `;;` comment lines from template schematics
- Restored KiCAD 9 format version (20250114) in templates

### copy_routing_pattern Empty Results (Fixed v2.2.2)

- Added geometric fallback when pads have no net assignments

### Schematic Component Corruption (Fixed v2.2.1)

- `add_schematic_component` no longer corrupts .kicad_sch files
- Rewritten to use text manipulation instead of sexpdata formatting

### SWIG/UUID Comparison Bugs (Fixed v2.2.0)

- Fixed SwigPyObject UUID comparison
- Fixed SWIG iterator invalidation after board.Remove()
- Added board.SetModified() to prevent dangling pointer crashes

## Reporting New Issues

If you encounter an issue not listed here:

1. **Check MCP logs:** `~/.kicad-mcp/logs/kicad_interface-<pid>.log` (one file per server process)
2. **Enable developer mode:** Set `KICAD_MCP_DEV=1` to capture session logs
3. **Check KiCAD version:** `python3 -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.GetBuildVersion())"` (must be 9.0+)
4. **Try the operation in KiCAD directly** -- is it a KiCAD issue?
5. **Open a GitHub issue** with:
   - Error message and log excerpt
   - Steps to reproduce
   - KiCAD version and OS
   - MCP session log (from `logs/` folder if dev mode is enabled)

---

## General Workarounds

### Server Will Not Start

```bash
# Check Python can import pcbnew
python3 -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.GetBuildVersion())"

# Check paths
python3 python/utils/platform_helper.py
```

### Commands Fail After Server Restart

```
# Board reference is lost on restart
# Always run open_project after server restart
```

### KiCAD UI Does Not Show Changes (SWIG Mode)

```
# File > Revert (or click reload prompt)
# Or: Close and reopen file in KiCAD
# Or: Use IPC backend for automatic updates
```

### IPC Not Connecting

```
# Ensure KiCAD is running
# Enable IPC: Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server
# Have a board open in PCB editor
# Check socket exists: ls /tmp/kicad/api.sock
```
