"""
Regression test for the symbol-to-schematic Y-axis flip in PinLocator.

Before the fix, pin_locator.py's get_pin_location() negated pin_data["y"]
twice in sequence (two identical blocks, one commented "Negate y here before
rotation" and a second commented "lib_symbols uses y-up; schematic uses y-down"
doing the exact same flip). The double-negation cancelled out, leaving pin
Y-coordinates mirrored about the symbol placement Y. For symmetric passives
(pin 1 and pin 2 electrically equivalent) the bug was invisible; for ICs with
non-equivalent pins it caused misrouted connections.

This test places a stock Device:R at a known absolute position and verifies
that pin 1 (symbol y=+3.81) resolves to an absolute Y *above* the placement
centre (i.e. placement_y - 3.81), matching KiCad's actual render and its
kicad-cli net extraction. The pre-fix code put pin 1 below the centre.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Asymmetric multi-pin regression (the case where the original bug hit hardest)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The symmetric-symbol tests above pass even with the pre-fix code because
# Device:R and Device:C are pin-equivalent — swap pin 1 and pin 2 in the
# netlist and the circuit still works. The bug only became visible on
# asymmetric, multi-pin ICs like RF_Module:ESP32-WROOM-32, where pin 3 (EN)
# and pin 35 (TXD0/IO1) are not interchangeable. With the original code,
# pins at library y=+30.48 (top of the symbol) were reported at world
# y=symbol_y+30.48 (bottom of the schematic), so labels meant for EN landed
# on TXD0, and ERC reported either a dangling label or a wrong connection.
#
# Issue #135 specifically asked for an asymmetric-symbol regression. Rather
# than depend on system libraries (RF_Module is not bundled with the repo),
# this fixture builds a minimal 6-pin asymmetric symbol inline and asserts
# every pin lands at the formula-predicted absolute position.
