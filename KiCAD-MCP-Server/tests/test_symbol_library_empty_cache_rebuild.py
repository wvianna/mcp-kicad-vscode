"""
Regression test for the "empty-cache early-return" bug in SymbolLibraryCommands.

Scenario
--------
When a project is opened for the first time (e.g. right after `create_project`)
the `sym-lib-table` may not exist on disk yet.  `SymbolLibraryManager.__init__`
succeeds but leaves `self.libraries` empty.

The original `_rebuild_if_needed` guard was:

    if self.library_manager.project_path == project_path:
        return   # ← BUG: triggers even when libraries == {}

Because `project_path` already matched, the manager was never rebuilt when the
sym-lib-table finally appeared, so subsequent list_symbols / search_symbols calls
returned nothing.

Fix: also require that at least one library was loaded before skipping the rebuild.
