Regression tests for issue #293:

    get_wire_connections reports phantom cross-unit pins in net membership

A multi-unit part is placed as several ``(symbol ...)`` instances that share
one reference designator but each carry their own ``(unit N)``, position and
rotation. Each instance only owns the pins defined in its unit's sub-symbol
(plus unit 0, common to all units).

The bug: ``_find_pins_on_net`` transformed *every* unit's pins against *every*
instance's position. When two units share an x-coordinate and their pins have
identical library offsets (the normal case for a dual op-amp), a sibling unit's
pin lands exactly on this instance's wire and is reported as a phantom member
of the net.

These tests place a 2-unit symbol whose two units share x and differ only in y,
wire each unit's output pin to a distinct passive, and assert that each net
contains only the pin from its own unit -- never the sibling unit's pin.

# Two-unit symbol "TEST:DualAmp":
#   unit 1 output = pin 3, unit 2 output = pin 7, both at lib offset (7.62, 0).
# Placed:
#   unit 1 at (100, 100) -> output pin 3 at (107.62, 100)
#   unit 2 at (100, 150) -> output pin 7 at (107.62, 150)
# A wire + resistor hangs off each output. Because both units share x=100 and
# both outputs are at lib-x +7.62, the pre-fix code transforms unit 2's pin 7
# against unit 1's instance -> (107.62, 100), landing on unit 1's wire, and
# vice versa. The fix must keep pin 7 off unit 1's net and pin 3 off unit 2's.
