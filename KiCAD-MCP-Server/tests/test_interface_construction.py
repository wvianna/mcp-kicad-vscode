"""Construction smoke test for KiCADInterface.

Every tool PR touches two places that no per-module unit test exercises
together: the handler import block and the ``command_routes`` dict in
``kicad_interface.py``. A route entry that references a renamed or
un-imported function passes every module-level test but raises ``NameError``
the moment the server constructs the interface — i.e. the server crashes at
startup while CI stays green. PR #308 shipped exactly that
(``"add_library_symbol_property": add_schematic_symbol_property`` after a
module rename); this file makes the whole class unshippable.

Relies on conftest.py's pcbnew stub (``__file__`` and ``GetBuildVersion``
are accessed at kicad_interface module level).
