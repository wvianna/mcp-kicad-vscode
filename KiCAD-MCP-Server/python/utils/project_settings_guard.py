"""Preserve hand-edited ``.kicad_pro`` settings across backend board saves.

In the long-lived backend process, pcbnew reuses a stale in-memory project
model when a project is re-opened: ``pcbnew.LoadBoard`` does not re-read a
hand-edited ``.kicad_pro``, and the next ``pcbnew.SaveBoard`` /
``BOARD.Save()`` (default ``aSkipSettings=False`` — including the
post-mutation auto-save) serializes that stale model over the file,
reverting custom net classes and ``netclass_patterns`` to Default-only.

The backend never legitimately mutates ``net_settings`` through the pcbnew
model (``create_netclass`` persists via direct JSON read-modify-write), so
it is always safe to restore the on-disk ``net_settings`` — and any dropped
unknown top-level keys — after a save, while letting SaveBoard's legitimate
updates (e.g. ``board.design_settings``) flow through.

All helpers are best-effort and never raise: a guard failure must not fail
the board operation it wraps.
